<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Mount Rainier National Park is visited annually
by increasing thousands of tourists. Many of them seek
information about the discoveries and explorations of the
mountain and its environs. Much of the information
sought, especially that about the origin of place names, has
never been published. The annals of discovery and exploration,
which have been published, have often appeared
in books, pamphlets, or periodicals not easily accessible.
It is the purpose of this work to gather the essential portions
of the desired information within a compact, usable
form.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1915, the mountain was for the
first time encircled by a large company of travelers. Small
parties, carrying their luggage and provisions on their
backs, had made the trip a number of times. The Mountaineers
Club, in 1915, conducted a party of one hundred,
with fully equipped pack train and commissary, around the
mountain. They camped each evening at or near the
snow-line. At the daily campfires extracts were read from
the original sources of the mountain's history. The interest
there manifested in such records gave additional impulse to
the preparation of this book.</p>

<p>It is natural that the chronological order should be
chosen in arranging the materials, beginning with the discovery
and naming of the mountain by Captain George
Vancouver of the British Navy. The records are then continued
to the present time. There still remains to be done
much scientific work on the glaciers, snowfields, rocks, and
plants within the Park. It is hoped that this book may
stimulate such field work as well as the publication of the
results.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>The reader will notice that several writers in referring to
the mountain use some form of the name Tacoma. The
editor has not hesitated to publish such names as were used
in the original articles here reproduced. In all other cases
he has used the name Mount Rainier, approved by the
United States Geographic Board.</p>

<p>In the separate chapters it will be noticed that the height
of the mountain has been placed at varying figures. The
United States Geological Survey has spoken on this subject
with apparent official finality, giving the altitude as
14,408 feet above sea level. How this height was determined
is told in the official announcement reproduced in
Chapter XVIII of the text, with comment thereon by
F. E. Matthes, one of the engineers of the United States
Geological Survey.</p>

<p>The place names within the Park have been derived
from such varied sources that it is well-nigh impossible
to ascertain the origin and meaning of all of them. For
the first time they are here (Chapter XIX) gathered into
a complete alphabetical arrangement with as full information
as is now available. The writer would welcome further
facts about any of the names.</p>

<p>In the introductory paragraphs before each chapter, the
editor has sought to express his acknowledgment for assistance
rendered by others in the compilation of the work.
For fear some may have been omitted he wishes here to
express gratitude for all such help and to mention especially
Professor J. Franklin Jameson, Director of the Department
of Historical Research of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington, for his assistance in securing photostat
reproductions of a number of rare items found in the
Library of Congress.</p>

<p>The editor also acknowledges the assistance rendered by
Victor J. Farrar, research assistant in the University of
Washington.</p>

I. THE MOUNTAIN DISCOVERED AND NAMED, 1792<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> CAPTAIN GEORGE VANCOUVER, R.N.</small></h2>

<blockquote><p class="hang">Captain George Vancouver, the great English navigator and
explorer, lived but forty years, from 1758 to 1798. He entered
the British navy on the <i>Resolution</i> under Captain James
Cook in 1771 and was with that even more famous explorer
during his second and third voyages, from 1772 to 1780. He
was placed in command of the <i>Discovery</i> and <i>Chatham</i> in
1791 and sent to the northwest coast of America. On this
voyage he discovered and named Puget Sound and many other
geographic features on the western coast of America.</p>

<p class="hang">The portions of his Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific
Ocean, giving the record of his discovery, naming, and exploration
in the vicinity of Mount Rainier, are taken from Volume II
of the second edition, published in London in 1801, pages 79,
118, and 134-138.</p></blockquote>


<p class="space-above">[Tuesday, May 8, 1792.] The weather was serene
and pleasant, and the country continued to exhibit,
between us and the eastern snowy range, the same
luxuriant appearance. At its northern extremity,
mount Baker bore by compass N. 22 E.; the round
snowy mountain, now forming its southern extremity,
and which, after my friend Rear Admiral Rainier, I
distinguished by the name of <span class="smcap">Mount Rainier</span>, bore
N. [S.] 42 E.</p>


<p class="space-above">[Saturday, May 19, 1792.] About noon, we passed
an inlet on the larboard or eastern shore, which seemed
to stretch far to the northward; but, as it was out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
line of our intended pursuit of keeping the continental
shore on board, I continued our course up the main inlet,
which now extended as far as, from the deck, the eye
could reach, though, from the mast-head, intervening
land appeared, beyond which another high round mountain
covered with snow was discovered, apparently
situated several leagues to the south of mount Rainier,
and bearing by compass S. 22 E. This I considered as a
further extension of the eastern snowy range; but the
intermediate mountains, connecting it with mount
Rainier, were not sufficiently high to be seen at that
distance.</p>


<p class="space-above">[Saturday, May 26, 1792.] Towards noon we landed
on a point on the eastern shore, whose latitude I observed
to be 47° 21&#8242;, round which we flattered ourselves
we should find the inlet take an extensive eastwardly
course. This conjecture was supported by the appearance
of a very abrupt division in the snowy range of
mountains immediately to the south of mount Rainier,
which was very conspicuous from the ship, and the
main arm of the inlet appearing to stretch in that direction
from the point we were then upon. We here dined,
and although our repast was soon concluded, the delay
was irksome, as we were excessively anxious to ascertain
the truth, of which we were not long held in suspense.
For having passed round the point, we found the inlet
to terminate here in an extensive circular compact bay,
whose waters washed the base of mount Rainier, though
its elevated summit was yet at a very considerable
distance from the shore, with which it was connected by
several ridges of hills rising towards it with gradual
ascent and much regularity. The forest trees, and the
several shades of verdure that covered the hills, gradually
decreased in point of beauty, until they became
invisible; when the perpetual clothing of snow commenced,
which seemed to form a horizontal line from
north to south along this range of rugged mountains,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
from whose summit mount Rainier rose conspicuously,
and seemed as much elevated above them as they were
above the level of the sea; the whole producing a most
grand, picturesque effect. The lower mountains, as
they descended to the right and left, became gradually
relieved of their frigid garment; and as they approached
the fertile woodland region that binds the
shores of this inlet in every direction, produced a pleasing
variety. We now proceeded to the N. W. in which
direction the inlet from hence extended, and afforded
us some reason to believe that it communicated with
that under the survey of our other party. This opinion
was further corroborated by a few Indians, who had in
a very civil manner accompanied us some time, and
who gave us to understand that in the north western
direction this inlet was very wide and extensive; this
they expressed before we quitted our dinner station, by
opening their arms, and making other signs that we
should be led a long way by pursuing that route;
whereas, by bending their arm, or spreading out their
hand, and pointing to the space contained in the curve
of the arm, or between the fore-finger and thumb, that
we should find our progress soon stopped in the direction
which led towards mount Rainier. The little
respect which most Indians bear to truth, and their
readiness to assert what they think is most agreeable
for the moment, or to answer their own particular wishes
and inclinations, induced me to place little dependance
on this information, although they could have no motive
for deceiving us.</p>

<p>About a dozen of these friendly people had attended
at our dinner, one part of which was a venison pasty.
Two of them, expressing a desire to pass the line of separation
drawn between us, were permitted to do so.
They sat down by us, and ate of the bread, and fish
that we gave them without the least hesitation; but on
being offered some of the venison, though they saw us
eat it with great relish, they could not be induced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
taste it. They received it from us with great disgust,
and presented it round to the rest of the party, by whom
it underwent a very strict examination. Their conduct
on this occasion left no doubt in our minds that
they believed it to be human flesh, an impression which
it was highly expedient should be done away. To satisfy
them that it was the flesh of the deer, we pointed
to the skins of the animal they had about them. In
reply to this they pointed to each other, and made signs
that could not be misunderstood, that it was the flesh
of human beings, and threw it down in the dirt, with
gestures of great aversion and displeasure. At length
we happily convinced them of their mistake by shewing
them a haunch we had in the boat, by which means
they were undeceived, and some of them ate of the
remainder of the pye with a good appetite.</p>

<p>This behavior, whilst in some measure tending to
substantiate their knowledge or suspicions that such
barbarities have existence, led us to conclude, that
the character given of the natives of North-West
America does not attach to every tribe. These people
have been represented not only as accustomed inhumanly
to devour the flesh of their conquered enemies;
but also to keep certain servants, or rather slaves, of
their own nation, for the sole purpose of making the
principal part of the banquet, to satisfy the unnatural
savage gluttony of the chiefs of this country, on their
visits to each other. Were such barbarities practiced
once a month, as is stated, it would be natural to suppose
these people, so inured, would not have shewn
the least aversion to eating flesh of any description;
on the contrary, it is not possible to conceive a greater
degree of abhorrence than was manifested by these
good people, until their minds were made perfectly
easy that it was not human flesh we offered them to
eat. This instance must necessarily exonerate at least
this particular tribe from so barbarous a practice; and,
as their affinity to the inhabitants of Nootka, and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the sea-coast, to the south of that place, in their
manners and customs, admits of little difference, it
is but charitable to hope those also, on a more minute
inquiry, may be found not altogether deserving such a
character. They are not, however, free from the general
failing attendant on a savage life. One of them
having taken a knife and fork to imitate our manner
of eating, found means to secrete them under his garment;
but, on his being detected, gave up his plunder
with the utmost good humour and unconcern.</p>

<p>They accompanied us from three or four miserable
huts, near the place where we had dined, for about four
miles; during which time they exchanged the only
things they had to dispose of, their bows, arrows, and
spears, in the most fair and honest manner, for hawk's
bells, buttons, beads, and such useless commodities.</p>

II. FIRST APPROACH TO THE MOUNTAIN, 1833<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> DOCTOR WILLIAM FRASER TOLMIE</small></h2>

<blockquote><p class="hang">Doctor William Fraser Tolmie was a medical officer in the
service of the Hudson's Bay Company. He was born at
Inverness, Scotland, on February 3, 1812, and died at Victoria,
British Columbia, on December 8, 1888. He was educated at
Glasgow, and when twenty years of age he joined the Hudson's
Bay Company. In 1833, he was located at Nisqually House,
Puget Sound. It was then that he made his trip to the mountain.
He later served at other posts in the Pacific Northwest,
and was raised to the rank of Chief Factor in 1856. He was
then placed on the board of management of the great company.
In 1860 he retired from the service.</p>

<p class="hang">In 1850 he was married to Jane, eldest daughter of Chief Factor
John Work. Their descendants still live at Victoria, British
Columbia. They, especially the son John W. Tolmie, have
compared this reproduction from Doctor Tolmie's diary with
the original manuscript to insure accuracy. So far as is now
known, this is the first record of a white man's close approach
to Mount Rainier.</p>

<p class="hang">It is pleasant to note that the new map of Mount Rainier National
Park, published by the United States Geological Survey, shows
the peak he climbed and the creek flowing near it bearing the
name of Tolmie.</p></blockquote>


<p>August 27, 1833. Obtained Mr. Herron's consent
to making a botanizing excursion to Mt. Rainier, for
which he has allowed 10 days. Have engaged two
horses from a chief living in that quarter, who came here
tonight, and Lachalet is to be my guide. Told the
Indians I am going to Mt. Rainier to gather herbs of
which to make medicine, part of which is to be sent
to Britain and part retained in case intermittent
fever should visit us when I will prescribe for the
Indians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Aug. 28. A tremendous thunder storm occurred
last night, succeeded by torrents of rain. The thunder
was very loud, and the lightening flashing completely
enlightened my apartment. Have been chatting
with Mr. Herron about colonizing Whidby's
island, a project of which he is at present quite full&mdash;more
anon. No horses have appeared. Understand
that the mountain is four days' journey distant&mdash;the
first of which can only be performed on horseback.
If they do not appear tomorrow I shall start with
Lachalet on foot.</p>

<p>Aug. 29. Prairie 8 miles N. of home. Sunset.
Busy making arrangements for journey, and while
thus occupied the guide arrived with 3 horses.
Started about 3, mounted on a strong iron grey, my
companions disposing of themselves on the other two
horses, except one, who walked. We were 6 in number.
I have engaged Lachalet for a blanket, and his
nephew, Lashima, for ammunition to accompany me
and Nuckalkut a Poyalip (whom I took for a native
of Mt. Rainier) with 2 horses to be guide on the mountain
after leaving the horse track, and Quilniash, his
relative, a very active, strong fellow, has volunteered
to accompany me. The Indians are all in great hopes
of killing elk and chevriel, and Lachalet has already
been selling and promising the grease he is to get. It
is in a great measure the expectation of finding game
that urges them to undertake the journey. Cantered
slowly along the prairie and are now at the residence
of Nuckalkut's father, under the shade of a lofty pine,
in a grassy amphitheatre, beautifully interspersed and
surrounded with oaks, and through the gaps in the
circle we see the broad plain extending southwards to
Nusqually. In a hollow immediately behind is a small
lake whose surface is almost one sheet of waterlilies
about to flower. Have supped on sallal; and at dusk
shall turn in.</p>

<p>Aug. 30. Sandy beach of Poyallipa River. Slept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
ill last night, and as I dozed in the morning was
aroused by a stroke across the thigh from a large decayed
branch which fell from the pine overshadowing
us. A drizzling rain fell during most of the night.
Got up about dawn, and finding thigh stiff and painful
thought a stop put to the journey, but after moving
about it felt easier. Started about sunrise, I
mounted on a spirited brown mare, the rest on passable
animals, except Nuckalkut, who bestrode a foal.
Made a northeasterly course through prairie. Breakfasted
at a small marsh on bread, sallal, dried cockels
and a small piece of chevriel saved from the last night's
repast of my companions (for I cannot call them attendants).
The points of wood now became broader,
and the intervening plain degenerated into prairions.
Stopped about 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> at the abode of 3 Tekatat families,
who met us rank and file at the door to shake hands.
Their sheds were made of bark resting on a horizontal
pole, supported at each end by tripods, and showed
an abundance of elk's flesh dried within. Two kettles
were filled with this, and, after smoking, my Indians
made a savage repast on the meat and bouillion,
Lachalet saying it was the Indian custom to eat a great
deal at once and afterwards abstain for a time; he,
however, has twice eaten since. Traded some dried
meat for 4 balls and 3 rings, and mounting, rode off
in the midst of a heavy shower. Ascended and descended
at different times several steep banks and
passed through dense and tangled thickets, occasionally
coming on a prairion. The soil throughout was of
the same nature as that of Nusqually. After
descending a very steep bank came to the Poyallip.
Lashima carried the baggage across on his head.
Rode to the opposite side through a rich alluvial plain,
3 or 4 miles in length and &#190; to 1 in breadth. It is
covered with fern about 8 feet high in some parts.
Passed through woods and crossed river several times.
About 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> dismounted and the horses and accoutrements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
were left in a wood at the river's brink. Started
now on foot for a house Nuckalkut knew, and after
traversing woods and twice crossing the torrents "on
the unsteadfast footing" of a log, arrived at the house,
which was a deserted one, and encamped on the dry
part of river's bed, along which our course lies tomorrow.
The Poyallip flows rapidly and is about 10
or 12 yards broad. Its banks are high and covered with
lofty cedars and pines. The water is of a dirty white
colour, being impregnated by white clay. Lachalet
has tonight been trying to persuade me from going to
the snow on the mountain.</p>

<p>Aug. 31. Slept well, and in the morning two salmon
were caught, on which we are to breakfast before starting.
After breakfast Quillihaish stuck the gills and
sound of the fish on a spit which stood before the
fire, so that the next comer might know that salmon
could be obtained there. Have traveled nearly the
whole day through a wood of cedar and pine, surface
very uneven, and after ascending the bed of river a
couple of miles are now encamped about ten yards
from its margin in the wood. Find myself very inferior
to my companions in the power of enduring
fatigue. Their pace is a smart trot which soon obliges
me to rest. The waters of the Poyallip are still of the
same colour. Can see a short distance up two lofty
hills covered with wood. Evening cloudy and rainy.
Showery all day.</p>

<p>Sunday, Sept. 1. Bank of Poyallip river. It has
rained all night and is now, 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, pouring down.
Are a good deal sheltered by the trees. My companions
are all snoozing. Shall presently arouse them
and hold a council of war. The prospect is very discouraging.
Our provisions will be expended today and
Lachalet said he thought the river would be too high
to be fordable in either direction. Had dried meat
boiled in a cedar bark kettle for breakfast. I got
rigged out in green blanket without trousers, in Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
style, and trudged on through the wood. Afterwood
exchanged blanket with Lachalet for Ouvrie's
capot, which has been on almost every Indian at Nusqually.
However, I found it more convenient than
the blanket. Our course lay up the river, which we
crossed frequently. The bed is clayey in most parts.
Saw the sawbill duck once or twice riding down on a
log and fired twice, unsuccessfully. Have been flanked
on both sides with high, pineclad hills for some time.
A short distance above encampment snow can be
seen. It having rained almost incessantly, have encamped
under shelving bank which has been undermined
by the river. Immense stones, only held in
situ by dried roots, form the roof, and the floor is very
rugged. Have supped on berries, which, when heated
with stones in kettle, taste like lozenges. Propose
tomorrow to ascend one of the snowy peaks above.</p>

<p>Sept. 2. Summit of a snowy peak immediately
under Rainier. Passed a very uncomfortable night in
our troglodytic mansion. Ascended the river for 3
miles to where it was shut in by amphitheatre of mountains
and could be seen bounding over a lofty precipice
above. Ascended that which showed most snow. Our
track lay at first through a dense wood of pine, but we
afterwards emerged into an exuberantly verdant gully,
closed on each side by lofty precipices. Followed fully
to near the summit and found excellent berries in
abundance. It contained very few Alpine plants.
Afterwards came to a grassy mound, where the sight
of several decayed trees induced us to encamp. After
tea I set out with Lachalet and Nuckalkut for the
summit, which was ankle deep with snow for &#188; mile
downwards. The summit terminated in abrupt precipice
directed northwards and bearing N. E. from
Mt. Rainier, the adjoining peak. The mists were at
times very dense, but a puff of S. W. wind occasionally
dispelled them. On the S. side of Poyallip is a range
of snow-dappled mountains, and they, as well as that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
on the N. side, terminate in Mt. Rainier, a short distance
to E. Collected a vasculum of plants at the
snow, and having examined and packed them shall
turn in. Thermometer at base, 54 deg., at summit of
ascent, 47 deg.</p>

<p>Sept. 3. Woody islet on Poyallip. It rained
heavily during night, but about dawn the wind shifting
to the N. E. dispersed the clouds and frost set in.
Lay shivering all night and roused my swarthy companions
twice to rekindle the fire. At sunrise, accompanied
by Quilliliash, went to the summit and
found the tempr. of the air 33 deg. The snow was spangled
and sparkled brightly in the bright sunshine. It
was crisp and only yielded a couple of inches to the
pressure of foot in walking. Mt. Rainier appeared
surpassingly splendid and magnificent; it bore, from
the peak on which I stood, S. S. E., and was separated
from it only by a narrow glen, whose sides, however,
were formed by inaccessible precipices. Got all my
bearings more correctly to-day, the atmosphere being
clear and every object distinctly perceived. The
river flows at first in a northerly direction from the
mountain. The snow on the summit of the mountain
adjoining Rainier on western side of Poyallip is continuous
with that of latter, and thus the S. Western
aspect of Rainier seemed the most accessible. By
ascending the first mountain through a gully in its
northern side, you reach the eternal snow of Rainier,
and for a long distance afterwards the ascent is very
gradual, but then it becomes abrupt from the sugarloaf
form assumed by the mountain. Its eastern side
is steep on its northern aspect; a few glaciers were seen
on the conical portion; below that the mountain is
composed of bare rock, apparently volcanic, which
about 50 yards in breadth reaches from the snow to
the valley beneath and is bounded on each side by bold
bluff crags scantily covered with stunted pines. Its
surface is generally smooth, but here and there raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
into small points or knobs or arrowed with short and
narrow longitudinal lines in which snow lay. From
the snow on western border the Poyallipa arose, and
in its course down this rock slope was fenced into the
eastward by a regular elevation of the rock in the
form of a wall or dyke, which at the distance I viewed it
at, seemed about four feet high and four hundred yards
in length. Two large pyramids of rock arose from the
gentle acclivity at S. W. extremity of mountain, and
around each the drifting snow had accumulated in
large quantity, forming a basin apparently of great
depth. Here I also perceived, peeping from their
snowy covering, two lines of dyke similar to that already
mentioned.</p>

<p>Sept. 4. Am tonight encamped on a small eminence
near the commencement of prairie. Had a tedious
walk through the wood bordering Poyallip, but accomplished
it in much shorter time than formerly.
Evening fine.</p>

<p>Sept. 5. Nusqually. Reached Tekatat camp in
the forenoon and regaled on boiled elk and shallon.
Pushed on ahead with Lachalet and Quilliliash, and
arrived here in the evening, where all is well.</p>

III. FIRST RECORDED TRIP THROUGH NACHES PASS, 1841<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> LIEUTENANT ROBERT E. JOHNSON, U.S.N.</small></h2>

<blockquote><p class="hang">The proper and official title of the United States Exploring Expedition,
1838-1842, by common speech has been contracted
to the Wilkes Expedition. The commander of the expedition
was Charles Wilkes, who entered the United States Navy as a
midshipman on January 1, 1818. On July 25, 1866, he was promoted
to rear-admiral on the retired list. He was born at
New York City on April 3, 1798, and died at Washington
City on February 8, 1877.</p>

<p class="hang">He was honored in Europe and America for his scientific attainments,
especially in connection with the expedition that now
bears his name. That voyage with a squadron of American
naval vessels was for the purpose of increasing the world's
knowledge of geography and kindred sciences. They reached
Puget Sound in 1841 and, while making headquarters at Nisqually
House of the Hudson's Bay Company, Commander
Wilkes sent Lieutenant Robert E. Johnson in command of a
party to cross the Cascade Range. Search in the Navy Department
revealed only scant information that Lieutenant
Johnson was from North Carolina. The Historical Commission
of that State and others there have failed to find information
about his subsequent career.</p>

<p class="hang">Since he speaks of obtaining a guide, it is likely that he was not
the first white man to cross the Cascades, but he was the first
to leave us a known record. The portions of that record which
bear upon Mount Rainier and its environs is here reproduced.</p>

<p class="hang">Commander Wilkes, before giving the record of his subordinate,
makes reference to the peak as follows: "The height of Mount
Rainier was obtained by measuring a base line on the prairies,
in which operation I was assisted by Lieutenant Case, and the
triangulation gave its height, twelve thousand three hundred
and thirty feet." (Narrative, Volume IV., page 413.)</p>

<p class="hang">The final reports of the expedition were to appear in twenty-four
large volumes and eleven atlases. Several of the volumes were
never published, and of those completed only one hundred sets
were printed. The rare monographs were full of information.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
The first part or "Narrative" in five volumes was issued in
several editions. The portions here reproduced are taken from
the edition by Lea and Blanchard, Philadelphia, 1845, Volume
IV., pages 418-429 and 468-470.</p></blockquote>


<p>I have before stated that Lieutenant Johnson's party
was ready for departure on the 19th May [1841]; that
it consisted of Lieutenant Johnson, Messrs. Pickering,
Waldron, and Brackenridge, a sergeant of marines, and
a servant. I must do justice to the exertions of this
officer in getting ready for his journey, which he accomplished
in less time than I anticipated, as the delays
incident to setting out on a novel expedition, and one
believed by most persons to be scarcely practicable
in the summer season, are great and tantalizing. In
making preparations for such a journey, the Indians
were to be bargained with, and, as I have before had
occasion to remark, are enough to tire the patience of
Job himself. First, the Indian himself is to be sought
out; then the horse is to be tried; next the price is to
be discussed, then the mode of payment, and finally
the potlatch: each and all are matters of grave consideration
and delay, during which the Indians make a
business of watching every circumstance of which they
can take advantage. No one can be sure of closing his
bargain, until the terms are duly arranged, the potlatch
given, and the horse delivered. After obtaining
horses, Lieutenant Johnson had the saddles, alforcas,
saddle-cloths, saddle-trees or pack-saddles, etc., with
a variety of lashings, to prepare. For many of these
we were indebted to the kindness of Captain M'Niel
and Mr. Anderson.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Others were made on board the
ship, after a pattern lent us. One of the most important
persons to obtain was a good guide, and hearing
of one who resided at the Cowlitz river, by the name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of Pierre Charles,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he was at once sent for; but I did
not think it worth while to detain the party until his
arrival, as he could easily overtake it. Lieutenant
Johnson, therefore, was directed to hurry his departure,
and to set out, which he did on the 19th May, at noon,
and proceeded to the prairie about two miles distant,
where the party encamped.</p>

<p>There is little danger on these expeditions of having
too few articles: the great difficulty is to avoid having
too many. It turned out as I had anticipated. The
first night passed in their tent fully satisfied them of
this, and taught them to dispense with all other bedding
save blankets.</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson rode to the encampment before night,
bringing the news of the arrival of Pierre Charles at the
fort; whereupon Lieutenant Johnson returned to make
an agreement with him and his companion. This
was done, although, as is to be supposed, their demands
were exorbitant, in consequence of the belief that their
services were indispensable.</p>

<p>Pierre Charles's companion was a young man, named
Peter Bercier, (a connexion of Plomondon)<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who spoke
English, and all the languages of the country.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th, they obtained an accession
to their horses, and set out on their route towards
the mountains. Although the possibility of crossing
them was doubted, yet I felt satisfied if exertion and
perseverance could effect the object, the officer who had
charge of the party would succeed. This day, they
made but five miles; after which they encamped, at the
recommendation of Pierre Charles, in order that the
horses might not be over-fatigued, and be able to get
good pasture and water. Here a number of natives
visited the camp. Pine trees were in large numbers,
many of them upwards of one hundred and thirty feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>in height. On the banks of a small stream, near their
camp, were found the yellow Ranunculus, a species of
Trillium, in thickets, with large leaves and small
flowers, Lupines, and some specimens of a cruciferous
plant.</p>

<p>On the 21st they made an early start, and in the
forenoon crossed the Puyallup, a stream about seventy
feet wide; along which is a fine meadow of some extent,
with clumps of alder and willow: the soil was of a black
turfy nature. After leaving the meadow-land, they
began to ascend along a path that was scarcely visible
from being overgrown with Gaultheria, Hazel, Spiræa,
Vaccinium, and Cornus.</p>

<p>During the day, they crossed the Stehna.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the
evening, after making sixteen miles, they encamped at
the junction of the Puyallup with the Upthascap.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Near by was a hut, built of the planks of the Arbor
Vitæ (Thuja), which was remarkably well made; and
the boards used in its structure, although split, had all
the appearance of being sawn: many of them were
three feet wide, and about fifteen feet long. The hut
was perfectly water-tight. Its only inhabitants were
two miserable old Indians and two boys, who were
waiting here for the arrival of those employed in the
salmon-fishery. The rivers were beginning to swell
to an unusual size, owing to the melting of the snows
in the mountains; and in order to cross the streams,
it became necessary to cut down large trees, over which
the packs were carried, while the horses swam over.
These were not the only difficulties they had to encounter:
the path was to be cut for miles through
thickets of brushwood and fallen timber; steep precipices
were to be ascended, with slippery sides and
entangled with roots of every variety of shape and size,
in which the horses' legs would become entangled, and
before reaching the top be precipitated, loads and all,
to the bottom. The horses would at times become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>jammed with their packs between trees, and were not
to be disengaged without great toil, trouble, and
damage to their burdens. In some cases, after succeeding
in getting nearly to the top of a hill thirty or forty
feet high, they would become exhausted and fall over
backwards, making two or three somersets, until they
reached the bottom, when their loads were again to be
arranged.</p>

<p>On the 22d, their route lay along the banks of the
Upthascap,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which is a much wider stream than the
Puyallup. A short distance up, they came to a fish-weir,
constructed as the one heretofore described, on
the Chickeeles,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> though much smaller.</p>

<p>This part of the country abounds with arbor-vitæ
trees, some of which were found to be thirty feet in
circumference at the height of four feet from the ground,
and upwards of one hundred feet high. Notwithstanding
the many difficulties encountered, they this day
made about twelve miles.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23d, just as they were about
to leave their camp, their men brought in a deer, which
was soon skinned and packed away on the horses.
This was the first large game they had obtained,
having previously got only a few grouse.</p>

<p>They had now reached the Smalocho,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which runs
to the westward, and is sixty-five feet wide: its depth
was found to be four and a half feet, which, as it was
also rapid, was too great for the horses to ford and
carry their loads. The Indians now became serviceable
to them. Lieutenant Johnson had engaged several
that were met on their way, and they now amounted
to thirteen, who appeared for a time lively and contented.
This, however, was but a forerunner of discontent,
and a refusal to go any farther; but with
coaxing and threatening they were induced to proceed.</p>

<p>The road or way, after passing the river, was over a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
succession of deep valleys and hills, so steep that it was
difficult for a horse to get up and over them with a
load, and the fall of a horse became a common occurrence.
They were all, however, recovered without injury,
although one of them fell upwards of one hundred
feet; yet in consequence of his fall having been repeatedly
broken by the shrubs and trees, he reached
the bottom without injury to himself, but with the
loss of his load, consisting of their camp utensils, &amp;c.,
which were swept off by the rapid current of the river.</p>

<p>The route lay, for several days, through forests of
spruce, and some of the trees that had fallen measured
two hundred and sixty-five feet in length. One of
these, at the height of ten feet from the roots, measured
thirty-five feet in circumference, and at the end which
had been broken off in its fall, it was found to be eighteen
inches in diameter, which would make the tree little
short of three hundred feet when it was growing. The
stems of all these trees were clear of branches to the
height of one hundred and fifty feet from the ground,
and perfectly straight. In many cases it was impossible
to see over the fallen trees, even when on horseback,
and on these, seedlings were growing luxuriantly,
forcing their roots through the bark and over the body
of the trunk till they reached the ground. Many
spruces were seen which had grown in this way; and
these, though of considerable size, still retained the
form of an arch, showing where the old tree had lain,
and under which they occasionally rode. As may be
supposed, they could not advance very rapidly over
such ground, and Lieutenant Johnson remarks, that
although he was frequently desirous of shortening the
road, by taking what seemed a more direct course, he
invariably found himself obliged to return to the Indian
trail.</p>

<p>Daylight of the 24th brought with it its troubles: it
was found that the horses had strayed,&mdash;a disaster
that the Indians took quite coolly, hoping it would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the cause of their return. After a diligent search, the
horses were found in places where they had sought
better food, although it was scanty enough even there.</p>

<p>During the day, the route led along the Smalocho,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
which runs nearly east and west; and they only left
its banks when they were obliged to do so by various
impassable barriers. This part of the country is composed
of conical hills, which are all thickly clothed with
pine trees of gigantic dimensions. They made nine
miles this day, without accident; but when they
encamped, they had no food for the horses except fern.
The animals, in consequence, seemed much overcome,
as did also the Indians, who had travelled the whole
day with heavy loads. Lieutenant Johnson, by way of
diverting the fatigue of the latter, got up a shooting-match
for a knife, the excitement of which had the
desired effect.</p>

<p>The trees hereabout were chiefly the cotton-wood,
maple, spruce, pine, and elder, and some undergrowth
of raspberry, the young shoots of which the natives eat
with great relish.</p>

<p>On the 25th, they set out at an early hour, and found
the travelling less rough, so that they reached the foot
of La Tête<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> before noon, having accomplished eleven
miles. Lieutenant Johnson with the sergeant ascended
La Tête, obtained the bearings, from its summit, of all
the objects around, and made its height by barometer,
two thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight feet:
its latitude was fixed at 47° 08&#8242; 54&#8243; N. This mountain
was entirely destitute of wood; but, having been burnt
over, was found strewn with huge charred trunks, and
the whole ground covered with ashes. The inclination
of its sides was about fifty degrees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p>The country around seemed one continued series of
hills, and like La Tête had suffered from the fire.
According to the natives, although the wood on the
mountains was destroyed many years since, yet it was
still observed to be on fire, in some places, about two
years ago. Most of the tops of the distant peaks had
snow on them. To the east was seen the appearance
of two valleys, through which the two branches of the
Smalocho<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> flow.</p>

<p>On descending from La Tête, the river was to be
crossed: this was found too deep to be forded, and it
consequently became necessary to form a bridge to
transport the baggage, by cutting down trees. The
current was found to run 6·2 miles per hour. They had
been in hopes of reaching the Little Prairie before night,
but in consequence of this delay, were forced to encamp
before arriving there.</p>

<p>The Indians complained much of the want of food:
many of the horses also were exhausted for the same
cause, and exhibited their scanty nourishment in their
emaciated appearance.</p>

<p>On the 26th, they reached the Little Prairie at an
early hour, where, after consultation, it was determined
to wait a day to recruit the horses, as this was the only
place they could obtain food. It was also desirable to
ascertain the practicability of passing the mountain
with the horses, and at the same time to carry forward
some of the loads, that the horses might have as little
as possible to transport. Mr. Waldron and Pierre
Charles were therefore sent forward with the Indians,
having loads of fifty pounds each, to ascend the mountain,
while Lieutenant Johnson remained with the camp
to get observations. Dr. Pickering and Mr. Brackenridge
accompanied the party of Mr. Waldron to the
snow-line. The prairie on which they had encamped
was about two and a half acres in extent, and another
of the same size was found half a mile farther east.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>The 27th was employed by Lieutenant Johnson in
determining the positions of this prairie, which proved
to be in latitude 47° 05&#8242; 51&#8243; N., and longitude 120°
13&#8242; W.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The variation was 19° 39&#8242; easterly. At
sunset, messengers arrived from Mr. Waldron, who had
reached the summit at noon, and was to proceed down
to the snow-line to encamp. The snow was found to
be about ten feet deep, and the party crossing sank
about ankle-deep, for which reason opinions varied as
to the possibility of getting the horses over; but it was
determined to make the trial. Lieutenant Johnson,
therefore, set out, leaving a supply of food with an
old Indian and a horse, both of whom were worn out,
and unable to proceed.</p>

<p>By eleven o'clock, they were met by Pierre Charles
and the Indians, who gave some slight hopes of accomplishing
the task of getting all over. Lieutenant
Johnson determined to take only the strongest horses to
the edge of the snow. At half-past 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, they reached
the best practicable encampment, being a mile beyond
the place where Mr. Waldron had encamped two days
before. The snow having melted so rapidly, Lieutenant
Johnson, taking all things into consideration, determined,
notwithstanding the forebodings of failure held out by
the party that had gone before, to make the attempt. It
now became necessary to push on with as much haste as
possible, on account of the state of their provisions; for
what with the loss sustained in fording the river, and in
consumption, they were obliged to adopt an allowance.</p>

<p>On the 29th, they departed, at early dawn, in order
to take advantage of the firmness of the snow, occasioned
by the last night's frost. They ascended rapidly,
and passed over the worst of the way, the horses sinking
no deeper than their fetlocks. They first passed over a
narrow ridge, and then a succession of small cones, until
they reached the summit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>Mount Rainier, from the top, bore south-southwest,
apparently not more than ten miles distant. A profile
of the mountain indicates that it has a terminal crater,
as well as some on its flanks. The barometer stood
at 24·950 in.: five thousand and ninety-two feet.
There was another, to the north-northeast, covered with
snow, and one to the west appeared about two hundred
feet higher than the place where the observations were
taken. This latter had suffered from fire in the same
way as La Tête, and showed only a few patches of snow.
To the eastward, a range of inferior height, running
north and south, was in view, without snow.</p>

<p>On the western ascent of this mountain, the pines were
scrubby; but at the summit, which was a plain, about
a mile in length by half a mile wide, they were straight
and towering, about eighty feet in height, without any
limbs or foliage, except at the top. The distance
travelled over the top was about five miles. On descending
the east side, the snow was much deeper and
softer, but the horses managed to get along well, and
without accident.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Johnson, in following the party, missed
the trail, and lost his way for three or four hours. On
discovering the camp of those who had gone before,
on the opposite side of a stream, he attempted to cross
it on a log, in doing which his foot slipped, and he was
precipitated into the water. Although his first thought
was to save the chronometer from accident, it was too
late, for the watch had stopped; it was not, however,
so far injured as not to be set a-going, and it continued
to go during the remainder of the journey: the only
use I have been able to make of his subsequent observations,
was to obtain the relative meridian distances
between the points visited, without the absolute longitude.
It is needless to say, that I placed little or no
dependence on them, in constructing the map.</p>

<p>Although the horses had, with one or two exceptions,
reached the eastern side of the mountain, yet they,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
together with the Indians, were very much exhausted.
The time had now come when the Indians, according to
agreement, were to be paid off, and they had done much
more than they agreed to do, having crossed the mountain
twice.</p>

<p>Finding the necessity of retaining all the blankets
that had been brought with them, in order to buy horses,
Lieutenant Johnson proposed to the Indians to receive
an order on Nisqually, in lieu of the immediate delivery
of the blankets. This they readily assented to, and
also willingly gave up those that had already been paid
them, on receiving a similar order,&mdash;thus showing a
spirit of accommodation highly praiseworthy. Only
two of them returned to Nisqually, to whom were
entrusted the botanical specimens, and the care of the
horses left upon the road.</p>

<p>The banks of the small streams on the eastern side of
the mountain were bordered with the greatest variety
of trees and shrubs, consisting of poplars, buckthorn
fifty feet high, dogwood thirty to forty feet high, several
species of willow, alder, two species of maple, and
occasionally a yew. The undergrowth was composed of
Hazel, Vaccinium, Gaultheria, and a prickly species of
Aralia. The herbaceous shrubs were Goodyera, Neottia,
Viola, Claytonia, Corallorrhiza. The latter, however,
were not in flower.</p>

<p>The party on foot, after leaving the Little Prairie
about half a mile, crossed the northern branch of the
Smalocho,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
which was found much swollen and very
rapid. Two trees were cut down to form a bridge.
After this, the walking through the forest became
smooth and firm, and they passed on at a rapid pace.
The Indians, although loaded with ninety pounds of
baggage, kept up with the rest. At nightfall they
encamped at the margin of the snow.</p>

<p>On lighting their fires, they accidentally set fire to the
moss-covered trees, and in a few moments all around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
them was a blazing mass of flame, which compelled
them to change their quarters farther to windward.
They had made eighteen miles. But few plants were
found, the season being too early for collecting at so
high an elevation. The ground was covered with
spruce-twigs, which had apparently been broken off
by the weight of the snow. The summit was passed
through an open space about twenty acres in extent.
This glade was surrounded with a dense forest of spruce
trees. There was no danger in walking except near the
young trees, which had been bent down by the snow,
but on passing these they often broke through, and
experienced much difficulty in extricating themselves,
particularly the poor Indians, with their heavy burdens.
The breadth of snow passed over was about eight miles.
At three o'clock they reached the
Spipen<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
River, where they encamped: this camp was found to be two thousand
five hundred and forty-one feet above the level
of the sea. The vegetation appeared to our botanical
gentlemen farther advanced on the east side than on
the west, at the same height; the Pulmonarias and
several small annuals were more forward. There were
only a few pine trees, and those small, seen on the west
side of the ridge; and on the east side, there was a
species of larch, the hackmatack of the country. While
they remained at this camp, they found a Pyrola, and
some new ferns.</p>

<p>The country about the Spipen<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
is mountainous and
woody, with a narrow strip of meadow-land along its
banks. Mr. Waldron had, on arriving at the camp,
sent Lachemere, one of the Indians, down the river to
an Indian chief, in order to procure horses. Those that
remained after providing for the baggage, were consequently
assigned each to two or three individuals to
ride and tye on their route.</p>

<p>On the 30th, they proceeded down the Spipen, making
a journey of eighteen miles, and passed another branch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of the river, the junction of which augmented its size
very considerably. Its banks, too, became perpendicular
and rocky, with a current flowing between them at
the rate of six or seven miles an hour. After the junction,
the stream was about one hundred feet broad, and
its course was east-southeast.</p>

<p>The vegetation on the east side of the mountains was
decidedly more advanced than that to the west, and
several very interesting species of plants were met with
by the botanists, on the banks of the streams: among
them were Pæonia brownii, Cypripedium oregonium,
Pentstemon, Ipomopsis elegans, and several Compositæ,
and a very handsome flowering shrub, Purshia tridentata.</p>

<p>On the 31st, they continued their route over a rough
country, in some places almost impassable for a horse
from its steepness, and in others so marshy as to require
much caution to prevent being mired.</p>

<p>During the morning, they met two Indians, who
informed them that the chief of the Yakima tribe was
a short distance in advance, waiting to meet them, and
that he had several horses. At noon they reached a
small prairie on the banks of the river, where old Tidias,
the chief, was seen seated in state to receive Lieutenant
Johnson; but this ceremony was unavoidably broken
in upon by the necessity of getting the meridian observations.
The chief, however, advanced towards him
with every mark of friendship, giving the party a
hearty welcome. In person he was tall, straight, and
thin, a little bald, with long black hair hanging down
his back, carefully tied with a worsted rag. He was
grave, but dignified and graceful. When they had been
seated, and after smoking a couple of pipes in silence,
he intimated that he was ready for a talk, which then
followed, relative to the rivers and face of the country;
but little information was obtained that could be depended
upon.</p>

<p>This tribe subsist chiefly upon salmon and the cammass-root:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
game is very scarce, and the beaver have
all disappeared. The cammass-root is pounded and
made into a sort of cake, which is not unpleasant,
having a sweetish taste, but it is very dry, although
some of the party took a fancy to it.</p>

<p>Tidias had with him an old man almost blind, who
claimed much respect, and two young men, whose dress
of buckskin, profusely ornamented with beads, was
much admired by the party. During the talk, the old
chief expressed himself delighted to see the white men,
and spoke of his own importance, his immense territory,
etc., in a style of boasting, to which the Indians are
very much addicted. He said that he was desirous
of affording all the accommodation he could to the
party. But although he had eight or ten fine horses
with him, he would not agree to part with them, as
they were all his favourites. He was presented with
a variety of articles, in return for which he gave the
party a few dried salmon.</p>

<p>Towards evening, old Tidias took leave of them,
saying that it was not proper for an Indian to encamp
in the same place with a white man, and with a promise
that he would have horses by ten o'clock the next day;
but he had a game to play by procrastinating, in which
he thoroughly succeeded.</p>

<p>In the morning they reached the Indian camp below,
but no horses had arrived. It was far, they said, to
Tidias's house; a man could not go thither and return
in the same day; no horses or salmon could be brought;
no one could be permitted to go. Lieutenant Johnson
was then told that the road he had to follow was a
"hungry" road. At last the Indian was induced by
high offers to exchange good horses for a great number
of bad ones, and finally consented to part with two
more. On quitting him they became thoroughly
aware that all the difficulties were owing, not to any
indisposition to sell, but were created for the purpose
of inducing high prices to be given.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The party now branched off at right angles to their
former route, Lieutenant Johnson heartily sick and tired
of his friend Tidias and his people. Two more of the
Indians here left them. The country they entered,
after passing a ridge about six hundred feet high, was
quite of a different aspect, forming long sloping hills,
covered with a scanty growth of pines. Many dry
beds of rivulets were passed, and the soil of the hills
produced nothing but a long thin grass. There are,
however, some small valleys where the growth of grass
is luxuriant, the pines are larger, and the scenery
assumed a park-like appearance.</p>

<p>From the summit of one of the hills, a sketch of
Mount Rainier, and of the intervening range, was
obtained.</p>

<p>On the top of the ridge they fell in with a number of
Spipen Indians, who were engaged in digging the cammass
and other roots. The latter were those of an
umbelliferous plant, oblong, tuberous, and in taste
resembling a parsnip. The process used to prepare
them for bread, is to bake them in a well-heated oven of
stones; when they are taken out they are dried, and
then pounded between two stones till the mass becomes
as fine as corn meal, when it is kneaded into cakes and
dried in the sun. These roots are the principal vegetable
food of the Indians throughout Middle Oregon.
The women are frequently seen, to the number of
twenty or thirty, with baskets suspended from the
neck, and a pointed stick in their hand, digging these
roots, and so intently engaged in the search for them,
as to pay no attention whatever to a passer-by. When
these roots are properly dried, they are stored away
for the winter's consumption. This day they made
only fifteen miles, in a northern direction.</p>

<p>On the 2d of June, they reached the Yakima, after
having crossed a small stream. The Yakima was too
deep for the horses to ford with their packs, and they
now for the first time used their balsas of India-rubber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
cloth, which were found to answer the purpose of floating
the loads across the stream.</p>

<p>This river is one hundred and fifty feet wide, and
pursues an east-southeast course, with a velocity of
more than four miles an hour. At this place were found
twenty migrating Indians, who have their permanent
residence on the banks lower down.</p>

<p>The chief, Kamaiyah, was the son-in-law of old
Tidias, and one of the most handsome and perfectly-formed
Indians they had met with. He was found
to be gruff and surly in his manners, which was thought
to be owing to his wish to appear dignified. These
Indians were living in temporary huts, consisting of
mats spread on poles. Among them was seen quite a
pretty girl, dressed in a shirt and trousers, with moccasins
of skin very much ornamented with fringe and
beads. They had a number of fine horses, but could not
be induced to part with any of them.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Johnson had now succeeded in purchasing
venison and salmon, and the party again had full
allowance.</p>

<p>On the 3d, they continued their route to the northward,
over gradually rising ground, and Lieutenant
Johnson having succeeded in purchasing three more
horses, only three of the party were now without them,
so that the riding and tye system was not quite so often
resorted to as before. On this plain was seen a number
of curlews, some grouse, and a large species of hare.
They encamped again near the snow, and found their
altitude greater than any yet reached, the barometer
standing at 24·750 in.: five thousand two hundred and
three feet. They had again reached the spruces and
lost the pine, which was only found on the hill-sides
and plains.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on the morning of the 4th of June, the
thermometer stood at 28°. They on that day continued
their route up the mountain and across its
summit, which was here and there covered with patches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of snow. I regret to record another accident to the
instruments. The sergeant, to whom the barometer
was intrusted by Lieutenant Johnson, in putting up
the instrument this morning, carelessly broke it; and
thus ended the barometrical experiments in the most
interesting portion of the route.</p>

<p>It is difficult to account for the scarcity of snow on a
much higher elevation than they had before reached,
and under circumstances which would appear to have
warranted a contrary expectation. Dr. Pickering was
induced to believe that this change in the climate is
owing to the open nature of the surrounding country;
its being devoid of dense forests, with but a few scattered
trees and no under-brush; and the vicinity to
elevated plains, and the ridge being of a less broken
character.</p>

<p>The early part of the day was cold, with showers of
sleet. On the crest of the mountain they passed over
swampy ground, with but a few patches of spruces:
after passing which, they began to descend very regularly
towards the Columbia, which they reached early
in the afternoon, about three miles below the Pischous
River.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The Columbia at this place is a rapid stream,
but the scenery differs entirely from that of other rivers:
its banks are altogether devoid of any fertile alluvial
flats; destitute even of scattered trees; there is no
freshness in the little vegetation on its borders; the
sterile sands in fact reach to its very brink, and it is
scarcely to be believed until its banks are reached that
a mighty river is rolling its waters past these arid
wastes.</p>

<blockquote><p>[The record of the journey to Fort Colville is omitted,
to be resumed when the party returning draws near the
environs of Mount Rainier. The portion omitted
extends from page 430 to 468 in the original publication.]</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>The party now pursued the route up the river, and
in two hours reached the Yakima, up whose valley they
passed, encamping after making twenty-five miles.
The country was rolling, and might be termed sandy
and barren.</p>

<p>Mount St. Helen's,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> with its snow-capped top, was
seen at a great distance to the west.</p>

<p>On the 5th, they continued their route, and at midday
were overtaken by an Indian, with a note informing
them of the arrival of Mr. Drayton at Wallawalla with
the brigade. This was quick travelling for news in
Oregon; for so slow is it usually carried, that our party
were the first to bring the news of the arrival and operations
of the squadron in Oregon. This intelligence had
not previously reached Wallawalla, although it is considered
to be on the direct post-route to the interior,
notwithstanding we had been in the country nearly two
months. The news of the murder of Mr. Black, in New
Caledonia, was nearly a year in reaching some points on
the coast.</p>

<p>This was one of the warmest days they had experienced,
and the thermometer under the shade of a
canopy stood at 108°. At a short distance from the
place where they stopped was a small hut, composed of
a few branches and reeds, which was thought to be
barely sufficient to contain a sheep; yet under it were
four generations of human beings, all females, seated in
a posture, which, to whites, would have been impracticable.
They had just procured their subsistence for
the day, and their meal consisted of the berries of the
dogwood. The scene was not calculated to impress one
very favourably with savage life. The oldest of these
had the cartilage of the nose pierced, but the others had
not; leading to the conclusion that the practice had
been discontinued for some years in the nation, who
still, however, retain the name.</p>

<p>The country exhibited little appearance of vegetation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the herbage was quite dried up, and from appearances
was likely to continue so throughout the season.
The prevailing vegetation consisted of bushes of wormwood,
stinted in growth, and unyielding.</p>

<p>After making thirty-three miles, they encamped
among loose sand, one hundred feet above the water of
the river. Many rattlesnakes were found in this vicinity.</p>

<p>Owing to the quantities of mosquitoes, combined
with the fear of snakes, the party obtained little or no
rest, and were all glad to mount their horses and proceed
on their way.</p>

<p>In the early part of the day, they arrived at the junction
of the Spipen with the Yakima: previous to this
they crossed another branch, coming in from the southwest;
the waters of the latter were very turbid, of a
dark-brown colour, and it was conjectured that it had its
source at or near Mount Rainier. Along its banks was
seen a range of basaltic columns. The Yakima was
crossed during the day in canoes, the river not being
yet fordable.</p>

<p>The country, which had for some days exhibited the
appearance of the Tillandsia districts of Peru, had now
begun to acquire a tinge of green, and some scattered
pine trees had become visible. Some small oaks were
passed, which appeared of a local character. This
night they again had a number of rattlesnakes in their
camp.</p>

<p>On the 8th, the valley had narrowed, and the banks
becoming more perpendicular, they had a great many
difficulties to encounter. They stopped at the camp of
old Tidias, whom, it will be recollected, they had
encountered after crossing the mountains, and from
whom they obtained some horses. They soon afterwards
arrived at the path where they had turned off
to the north. The river had fallen very much during
their absence, and there was a marked difference in the
season, the vegetation being much more backward than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in the parts they had recently visited. The berries
were just beginning to ripen, while in the plains, not
twenty miles distant, they were already over. Old
Tidias determined to accompany them to Nisqually,
taking with him his son, and lending them several
horses. The Spipen, up which they passed, was now
hemmed in by mountain ridges, occasionally leaving
small portions of level ground. They encamped at
the place they had occupied on the 30th of May.</p>

<p>The vegetation, since they had passed this place, had
so much advanced that they had difficulty in recognising
it again. The wet prairies were overgrown with
rank grass, from one to two feet in height. After a short
rest at the foot of the mountain, they began its ascent,
and reached the crest of the ridge in about three hours.
On every side they found a low growth of shrubs, which
they had not suspected when it was covered with snow,
and causing the summit to differ essentially from the
broad ridge they had crossed between the Yakima and
Pischous rivers. They encamped for the night on the
edge of a wet prairie, which afforded pasturage for their
horses.</p>

<p>The next day they passed through several similar
prairies, and descended the western slope of the mountain,
where they found more patches of snow than on
the east side. This was just the reverse of what they
had found on their previous passage; the season, too,
was evidently much less advanced. This circumstance
was supposed to be owing to the denser forest on the
west, as well as the absence of elevated plains.</p>

<p>They encamped the same night at the little prairie
before spoken of, at the foot of the western slope.
Before reaching it, they met a party of men and women
carrying a sick chief over the mountain, who was
evidently dying. It was affecting to see him stretching
forth his hand to them as they passed, as if desiring to
be friends with all before he died. He died the same
night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The two next days it rained almost constantly, but
they found the road much less difficult to travel than
before, and the streams were fordable, which enabled
them to make more rapid progress.</p>

<p>On the 13th, they passed the Smalocho, and on the
15th reached Nisqually, all well; having performed a
journey of about one thousand miles without any
material accident, except those that have been related
as having occurred to the instruments. They traversed
a route which white men had never before taken,
thus enabling us to become acquainted with a portion
of the country about which all had before been conjecture.
They had also made a large addition to our
collection of plants.</p>

IV. TACOMA AND THE INDIAN LEGEND OF HAMITCHOU<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> THEODORE WINTHROP</small></h2>

<blockquote><p class="hang">Theodore Winthrop was a descendant of the famous Governor
John Winthrop, of Massachusetts. He was born at New
Haven, Connecticut, on September 22, 1828, and lost his life
early in the Civil War near Great Bethel, Virginia, on June
10, 1861. His death was deeply mourned as of one who had
given great promise of success in the field of literature.</p>

<p class="hang">His book, <i>The Canoe and the Saddle</i>, has appeared in many
editions. It tells of his visit to Puget Sound and across the
Cascade Mountains in 1853. In that volume he declares that
the Indians called the mountain, Tacoma. So far as is known
to the editor, that is the first place that that name for the
mountain appeared in print.</p>

<p class="hang">In addition to this interesting fact, the book is a charming piece
of literature, and will endure as one of the classics on the
Pacific Northwest. The portions here reproduced relate to
the mountain. They are taken from an early edition of the
book published by the John W. Lovell Company of New York.
The edition carries no date, but the copyright notice is by
Ticknor and Fields, 1862. The parts used are from pages
43-45, and 123-176.</p>

<p class="hang">The author's niece, Elizabeth Winthrop Johnson, of Pasadena,
California, kindly furnished a photograph of Rowse's portrait
of her famous uncle.</p>

<p class="hang">The large and beautiful glacier sweeping from the northeast
summit past the western slope of Steamboat Prow now bears
the name of Winthrop Glacier.</p></blockquote>


<p>We had rounded a point, and opened Puyallop Bay,
a breadth of sheltered calmness, when I, lifting sleepy
eyelids for a dreamy stare about, was suddenly aware
of a vast white shadow in the water. What cloud,
piled massive on the horizon, could cast an image so
sharp in outline, so full of vigorous detail of surface?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
No cloud, as my stare, no longer dreamy, presently
discovered,&mdash;no cloud, but a cloud compeller. It
was a giant mountain dome of snow, swelling and
seeming to fill the aërial spheres as its image displaced
the blue deeps of tranquil water. The smoky haze
of an Oregon August hid all the length of its lesser
ridges, and left this mighty summit based upon uplifting
dimness. Only its splendid snows were visible, high
in the unearthly regions of clear blue noonday sky.
The shore line drew a cincture of pines across the broad
base, where it faded unreal into the mist. The same
dark girth separated the peak from its reflection, over
which my canoe was now pressing, and sending wavering
swells to shatter the beautiful vision before it.</p>

<p>Kingly and alone stood this majesty, without any
visible comrade or consort, though far to the north
and the south its brethren and sisters dominated their
realms, each in isolated sovereignty, rising above the
pine-darkened sierra of the Cascade Mountains,&mdash;above
the stern chasm where the Columbia, Achilles
of rivers, sweeps, short-lived and jubilant, to the sea,&mdash;above
the lovely vales of the Willamette and Umpqua.
Of all the peaks from California to Frazer's
River, this one before me was royalest. Mount
Regnier Christians have dubbed it, in stupid nomenclature
perpetuating the name of somebody or nobody.
More melodiously the siwashes call it Tacoma,&mdash;a
generic term also applied to all snow peaks. Whatever
keen crests and crags there may be in its rock
anatomy of basalt, snow covers softly with its bends
and sweeping curves. Tacoma, under its ermine, is
a crushed volcanic dome, or an ancient volcano fallen
in, and perhaps as yet not wholly lifeless. The domes
of snow are stateliest. There may be more of feminine
beauty in the cones, and more of masculine force and
hardihood in the rough pyramids, but the great domes
are calmer and more divine, and, even if they have
failed to attain absolute dignified grace of finish, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
are riven and broken down, they still demand our
sympathy for giant power, if only partially victor.
Each form&mdash;the dome, the cone, and the pyramid&mdash;has
its type among the great snow peaks of the Cascades.</p>

<blockquote><p>[Chapter VII, beginning at page 123 of the original
publication, is entitled "Tacoma."]</p></blockquote>

<p>Up and down go the fortunes of men, now benignant,
now malignant. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ante meridiem</i> of our lives,
we are rising characters. Our full noon comes, and
we are borne with plaudits on the shoulders of a grateful
populace. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Post meridiem</i>, we are ostracized, if
not more rudely mobbed. At twilight, we are perhaps
recalled, and set on the throne of Nestor.</p>

<p>Such slow changes in esteem are for men of some
import and of settled character. Loolowcan suffered
under a more rapidly fluctuating public opinion. At
the camp of the road-makers, he had passed through
a period of neglect,&mdash;almost of ignominy. My hosts
had prejudices against redskins; they treated the son
of Owhhigh with no consideration; and he became
depressed and slinking in manner under the influence
of their ostracism. No sooner had we disappeared
from the range of Boston eyes than Loolowcan resumed
his leadership and his control. I was very secondary
now, and followed him humbly enough up the heights
we had reached. Here were all the old difficulties
increased, because they were no longer met on a level.
We were to climb the main ridge,&mdash;the mountain of
La Tête,&mdash;abandoning the valley, assaulting the
summits. And here, as Owhhigh had prophesied in
his harangue at Nisqually, the horse's mane must be
firmly grasped by the climber. Poor, panting, weary
nags! may it be true, the promise of Loolowcan, that
not far away is abundant fodder! But where can
aught, save firs with ostrich digestion, grow on these
rough, forest-clad shoulders?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>So I clambered on till near noon.</p>

<p>I had been following thus for many hours the blind
path, harsh, darksome, and utterly lonely, urging
on with no outlook, encountering no landmark,&mdash;at
last, as I stormed a ragged crest, gaining a height that
overtopped the firs, and, halting there for panting
moments, glanced to see if I had achieved mastery as
well as position,&mdash;as I looked somewhat wearily
and drearily across the solemn surges of forest, suddenly
above their sombre green appeared Tacoma.
Large and neighbor it stood, so near that every jewel
of its snow-fields seemed to send me a separate ray;
yet not so near but that I could with one look take
in its whole image, from clear-cut edge to edge.</p>

<p>All around it the dark evergreens rose like a ruff;
above them the mountain splendors swelled statelier
for the contrast. Sunlight of noon was so refulgent
upon the crown, and lay so thick and dazzling in nooks
and chasms, that the eye sought repose of gentler
lights, and found it in shadowed nooks and clefts, where,
sunlight entering not, delicate mist, an emanation
from the blue sky, had fallen, and lay sheltered and
tremulous, a mild substitute for the stronger glory.
The blue haze so wavered and trembled into sunlight,
and sunbeams shot glimmering over snowy brinks so
like a constant avalanche, that I might doubt whether
this movement and waver and glimmer, this blending
of mist with noontide flame, were not a drifting smoke
and cloud of yellow sulphurous vapor floating over
some slowly chilling crater far down in the red crevices.</p>

<p>But if the giant fires had ever burned under that
cold summit, they had long since gone out. The dome
that swelled up passionately had crusted over and then
fallen in upon itself, not vigorous enough with internal
life to bear up in smooth proportion. Where it broke
into ruin was no doubt a desolate waste, stern, craggy,
and riven, but such drear results of Titanic convulsion
the gentle snows hid from view.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>No foot of man had ever trampled those pure
snows. It was a virginal mountain, distant from
the possibility of human approach and human inquisitiveness
as a marble goddess is from human
love.</p>

<p>Yet there was nothing unsympathetic in its isolation,
or despotic in its distant majesty. But this
serene loftiness was no home for any deity of those
that men create. Only the thought of eternal peace
arose from this heaven-upbearing monument like
incense, and, overflowing, filled the world with deep
and holy calm.</p>

<p>Wherever the mountain turned its cheek toward
the sun, many fair and smiling dimples appeared, and
along soft curves of snow, lines of shadow drew tracery
fair as the blue veins on a child's temple. Without
the infinite sweetness and charm of this kindly changefulness
of form and color, there might have been oppressive
awe in the presence of this transcendent glory
against the solemn blue of noon. Grace played over
the surface of majesty, as a drift of rose-leaves wavers
in the air before a summer shower, or as a wreath of
rosy mist flits before the grandeur of a storm. Loveliness
was sprinkled like a boon of blossoms upon sublimity.</p>

<p>Our lives forever demand and need visual images
that can be symbols to us of the grandeur or the sweetness
of repose. There are some faces that arise dreamy
in our memories, and look us into calmness in our
frantic moods. Fair and happy is a life that need
not call upon its vague memorial dreams for such
attuning influence, but can turn to a present reality,
and ask tranquillity at the shrine of a household goddess.
The noble works of nature, and mountains most
of all,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"have power to make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our noisy years seem moments in the being<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the eternal silence."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></div></div>

<p>And, studying the light and the majesty of Tacoma,
there passed from it and entered into my being, to
dwell there evermore by the side of many such, a
thought and an image of solemn beauty, which I could
thenceforth evoke whenever in the world I must have
peace or die. For such emotion years of pilgrimage
were worthily spent. If mortal can gain the thoughts
of immortality, is not his earthly destiny achieved?
For, when we have so studied the visible poem, and
so fixed it deep in the very substance of our minds,
there is forever with us not merely a perpetual possession
of delight, but a watchful monitor that will not
let our thoughts be long unfit for the pure companionship
of beauty. For whenever a man is false to the
light that is in him, and accepts meaner joys, or chooses
the easy indulgence that meaner passions give, then
every fair landscape in all his horizon dims, and all
its grandeurs fade and dwindle away, the glory vanishes,
and he looks, like one lost, upon his world, late so
lovely and sinless.</p>

<p>While I was studying Tacoma, and learning its
fine lesson, it in turn might contemplate its own image
far away on the waters of Whulge, where streams
from its own snows, gushing seaward to buffet in the
boundless deep, might rejoice in a last look at their
parent ere they swept out of Puyallop Bay. Other
large privilege of view it had. It could see what I
could not,&mdash;Tacoma the Less, Mt. Adams, meritorious
but clumsy; it could reflect sunbeams gracefully
across a breadth of forest to St. Helen's, the vestal
virgin, who still kept her flame kindled, and proved
her watchfulness ever and anon. Continuing its panoramic
studies, Tacoma could trace the chasm of the
Columbia by silver circles here and there,&mdash;could
see every peak, chimney, or unopened vent, from Kulshan
to Shasta Butte. The Blue Mountains eastward
were within its scope, and westward the faint-blue
levels of the Pacific. Another region, worthy of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
mountain's beholding, Tacoma sees, somewhat vague
and dim in distance: it sees the sweet Arcadian valley
of the Willamette, charming with meadow, park, and
grove. In no older world where men have, in all their
happiest moods, recreated themselves for generations
in taming earth to orderly beauty, have they achieved
a fairer garden than Nature's simple labor of love
has made there, giving to rough pioneers the blessings
and the possible education of refined and finished landscape,
in the presence of landscape strong, savage,
and majestic.</p>

<p>All this Tacoma beholds, as I can but briefly hint;
and as one who is a seer himself becomes a tower of
light and illumination to the world, so Tacoma, so
every brother seer of his among the lofty snow-peaks,
stands to educate, by his inevitable presence, every
dweller thereabouts. Our race has never yet come
into contact with great mountains as companions of
daily life, nor felt that daily development of the finer
and more comprehensive senses which these signal
facts of nature compel. That is an influence of the
future. The Oregon people, in a climate where being
is bliss,&mdash;where every breath is a draught of vivid
life,&mdash;these Oregon people, carrying to a new and
grander New England of the West a fuller growth of
the American Idea, under whose teaching the man of
lowest ambitions must still have some little indestructible
respect for himself, and the brute of most tyrannical
aspirations some little respect for others; carrying
the civilization of history where it will not suffer by
the example of Europe,&mdash;with such material, that
Western society, when it crystallizes, will elaborate
new systems of thought and life. It is unphilosophical
to suppose that a strong race, developing under the
best, largest, and calmest conditions of nature, will not
achieve a destiny.</p>

<p>Up to Tacoma, or into some such solitude of nature,
imaginative men must go, as Moses went up to Sinai,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that the divine afflatus may stir within them. The
siwashes appreciate, according to their capacity, the
inspiration of lonely grandeur, and go upon the mountains,
starving and alone, that they may become seers,
enchanters, magicians, diviners,&mdash;what in conventional
lingo is called "big medicine." For though the
Indians here have not peopled these thrones of their
world with the creatures of an anthropomorphic
mythology, they yet deem them the abode of Tamanoüs.
Tamanoüs is a vague and half-personified type
of the unknown, of the mysterious forces of nature;
and there is also an indefinite multitude of undefined
emanations, each one a tamanoüs with a small t, which
are busy and impish in complicating existence, or
equally active and spritely in unravelling it. Each
Indian of this region patronizes his own personal
tamanoüs, as men of the more eastern tribes keep a
private manitto, and as Socrates kept a daimôn. To
supply this want, Tamanoüs with a big T undergoes
an avatar, and incarnates himself into a salmon, a
beaver, a clam, or into some inanimate object, such as
a canoe, a paddle, a fir-tree, a flint, or into some elemental
essence, as fire, water, sun, mist; and tamanoüs
thus individualized becomes the "guide, philosopher,
and friend" of every siwash, conscious that otherwise
he might stray and be lost in the unknown realms of
Tamanoüs.</p>

<p>Hamitchou, a frowzy ancient of the Squallyamish,
told to Dr. Tolmie and me, at Nisqually, a legend of
Tamanoüs and Tacoma, which, being interpreted,
runs as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">Hamitchou's Legend</p>

<p>"Avarice, O Boston tyee," quoth Hamitchou, studying
me with dusky eyes, "is a mighty passion. Now,
be it known unto thee that we Indians anciently used
not metals nor the money of you blanketeers. Our
circulating medium was shells,&mdash;wampum you would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
name it. Of all wampum, the most precious is Hiaqua.
Hiaqua comes from the far north. It is a small, perforated
shell, not unlike a very opaque quill toothpick,
tapering from the middle, and cut square at both ends.
We string it in many strands, and hang it around the
neck of one we love,&mdash;namely, each man his own neck.
We also buy with it what our hearts desire. He who
has most hiaqua is best and wisest and happiest of all
the northern Haida and of all the people of Whulge.
The mountain horsemen value it; and braves of the
terrible Blackfeet have been known, in the good old
days, to come over and offer a horse or a wife for a
bunch of fifty hiaqua.</p>

<p>"Now, once upon a time there dwelt where this
fort of Nisqually now stands a wise old man of the
Squallyamish. He was a great fisherman and a great
hunter; and the wiser he grew, much the wiser he
thought himself. When he had grown very wise, he
used to stay apart from every other siwash. Companionable
salmon-boilings round a common pot had no
charms for him. 'Feasting was wasteful,' he said,
'and revellers would come to want.' And when they
verified his prophecy, and were full of hunger and empty
of salmon, he came out of his hermitage, and had salmon
to sell.</p>

<p>"Hiaqua was the pay he always demanded; and
as he was a very wise old man, and knew all the tide-ways
of Whulge, and all the enticing ripples and placid
spots of repose in every river where fish might dash
or delay, he was sure to have salmon when others
wanted, and thus bagged largely of its precious equivalent,
hiaqua.</p>

<p>"Not only a mighty fisher was the sage, but a mighty
hunter, and elk, the greatest animal of the woods,
was the game he loved. Well had he studied every
trail where elk leave the print of their hoofs, and
where, tossing their heads, they bend the tender twigs.
Well had he searched through the broad forest, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
found the long-haired prairies where elk feed luxuriously;
and there, from behind palisade fir-trees, he
had launched the fatal arrow. Sometimes, also, he
lay beside a pool of sweetest water, revealed to him
by gemmy reflections of sunshine gleaming through
the woods, until at noon the elk came down, to find
death awaiting him as he stooped and drank. Or
beside the same fountain the old man watched at night,
drowsily starting at every crackling branch, until,
when the moon was high, and her illumination declared
the pearly water, elk dashed forth incautious into the
glade, and met their midnight destiny.</p>

<p>"Elk-meat, too, he sold to his tribe. This brought
him pelf, but, alas for his greed, the pelf came slowly.
Waters and woods were rich in game. All the Squallyamish
were hunters and fishers, though none so skilled
as he. They were rarely in absolute want, and, when
they came to him for supplies, they were far too poor
in hiaqua.</p>

<p>"So the old man thought deeply, and communed
with his wisdom, and, while he waited for fish or beast,
he took advice within himself from his demon,&mdash;he
talked with Tamanoüs. And always the question
was, 'How may I put hiaqua in my purse?'</p>

<p>"Tamanoüs never revealed to him that far to the
north, beyond the waters of Whulge, are tribes with
their under lip pierced with a fishbone, among whom
hiaqua is plenty as salmonberries are in the woods
what time in mid-summer salmon fin it along the
reaches of Whulge.</p>

<p>"But the more Tamanoüs did not reveal to him
these mysteries of nature, the more he kept dreamily
prying into his own mind, endeavoring to devise some
scheme by which he might discover a treasure-trove
of the beloved shell. His life seemed wasted in the
patient, frugal industry, which only brought slow,
meagre gains. He wanted the splendid elation of
vast wealth and the excitement of sudden wealth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
His own peculiar tamanoüs was the elk. Elk was
also his totem, the cognizance of his freemasonry with
those of his own family, and their family friends in
other tribes. Elk, therefore, were every way identified
with his life; and he hunted them farther and farther
up through the forests on the flanks of Tacoma, hoping
that some day his tamanoüs would speak in the
dying groan of one of them, and gasp out the secret
of the mines of hiaqua, his heart's desire.</p>

<p>"Tacoma was so white and glittering, that it seemed
to stare at him very terribly and mockingly, and to
know his shameful avarice, and how it led him to take
from starving women their cherished lip and nose
jewels of hiaqua, and to give them in return only
tough scraps of dried elk-meat and salmon. When
men are shabby, mean, and grasping, they feel reproached
for their grovelling lives by the unearthliness
of nature's beautiful objects, and they hate flowers,
and sunsets, mountains, and the quiet stars of heaven.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," continued Hamitchou, "this wise
old fool of my legend went on stalking elk along the
sides of Tacoma, ever dreaming of wealth. And at
last, as he was hunting near the snows one day, one
very clear and beautiful day of late summer, when
sunlight was magically disclosing far distances, and
making all nature supernaturally visible and proximate,
Tamanoüs began to work in the soul of the miser.</p>

<p>"'Are you brave,' whispered Tamanoüs in the
strange, ringing, dull, silent thunder-tones of a demon
voice. 'Dare you go to the caves where my treasures
are hid?'</p>

<p>"'I dare,' said the miser.</p>

<p>"He did not know that his lips had syllabled a reply.
He did not even hear his own words. But all the
place had become suddenly vocal with echoes. The
great rock against which he leaned crashed forth, 'I
dare.' Then all along through the forest, dashing
from tree to tree and lost at last among the murmuring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of breeze-shaken leaves, went careering his answer,
taken up and repeated scornfully, 'I dare.' And after
a silence, while the daring one trembled and would
gladly have ventured to shout, for the companionship
of his own voice, there came across from the vast snow
wall of Tacoma a tone like the muffled, threatening
plunge of an avalanche into a chasm, 'I dare.'</p>

<p>"'You dare,' said Tamanoüs, enveloping him with
a dread sense of an unseen, supernatural presence;
'you pray for wealth of hiaqua. Listen!'</p>

<p>"This injunction was hardly needed; the miser
was listening with dull eyes kindled and starting. He
was listening with every rusty hair separating from
its unkempt mattedness, and outstanding upright, a
caricature of an aureole.</p>

<p>"'Listen,' said Tamanoüs, in the noonday hush.
And then Tamanoüs vouchsafed at last the great
secret of the hiaqua mines, while in terror near to death
the miser heard, and every word of guidance toward
the hidden treasure of the mountains seared itself
into his soul ineffaceably.</p>

<p>"Silence came again more terrible now than the
voice of Tamanoüs,&mdash;silence under the shadow of the
great cliff,&mdash;silence deepening down the forest vistas,&mdash;silence
filling the void up to the snows of Tacoma.
All life and motion seemed paralyzed. At last Skai-ki,
the Blue-Jay, the wise bird, foe to magic, sang cheerily
overhead. Her song seemed to refresh again the
honest laws of nature. The buzz of life stirred everywhere
again, and the inspired miser rose and hastened
home to prepare for his work.</p>

<p>"When Tamanoüs has put a great thought in a
man's brain, has whispered him a great discovery
within his power, or hinted at a great crime, that
spiteful demon does not likewise suggest the means of
accomplishment.</p>

<p>"The miser, therefore, must call upon his own skill
to devise proper tools, and upon his own judgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to fix upon the most fitting time for carrying out his
quest. Sending his squaw out to the kamas prairie,
under pretence that now was the season for her to
gather their winter store of that sickish-sweet esculent
root, and that she might not have her squaw's curiosity
aroused by seeing him at strange work, he began his
preparations. He took a pair of enormous elk-horns,
and fashioned from each horn a two-pronged pick or
spade, by removing all the antlers except the two topmost.
He packed a good supply of kippered salmon,
and filled his pouch with kinni kinnick for smoking
in his black stone pipe. With his bow and arrows
and his two elk-horn picks wrapped in buckskin hung
at his back, he started just before sunset, as if for a
long hunt. His old, faithful, maltreated, blanketless,
vermilionless squaw, returning with baskets full of
kamas, saw him disappearing moodily down the trail.</p>

<p>"All that night, all the day following, he moved
on noiselessly by paths he knew. He hastened on,
unnoticing outward objects, as one with a controlling
purpose hastens. Elk and deer, bounding through
the trees, passed him, but he tarried not. At night
he camped just below the snows of Tacoma. He was
weary, weary, and chill night-airs blowing down from
the summit almost froze him. He dared not take his
fire-sticks, and, placing one perpendicular upon a
little hollow on the flat side of the other, twirl the upright
stick rapidly between his palms until the charred
spot kindled and lighted his 'tipsoo,' his dry, tindery
wool of inner bark. A fire, gleaming high upon the
mountain-side, might be a beacon to draw thither
any night-wandering savage to watch in ambush,
and learn the path toward the mines of hiaqua. So
he drowsed chilly and fireless, awakened often by dread
sounds of crashing and rumbling among the chasms
of Tacoma. He desponded bitterly, almost ready to
abandon his quest, almost doubting whether he had
in truth received a revelation, whether his interview
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with Tamanoüs had not been a dream, and finally
whether all the hiaqua in the world was worth this
toil and anxiety. Fortunate is the sage who at such
a point turns back and buys his experience without
worse befalling him.</p>

<p>"Past midnight he suddenly was startled from his
drowse, and sat bolt upright in terror. A light.
Was there another searcher in the forest, and a bolder
than he? That flame just glimmering over the tree-tops,
was it a camp-fire of friend or foe? Had Tamanoüs
been revealing to another the great secret? No,
smiled the miser, his eyes fairly open, and discovering
that the new light was the moon. He had been waiting
for her illumination of paths heretofore untrodden
by mortal. She did not show her full, round jolly
face, but turned it askance as if she hardly liked to be
implicated in this night's transaction.</p>

<p>"However, it was light he wanted, not sympathy,
and he started up at once to climb over the dim snows.
The surface was packed by the night's frost, and his
moccasins gave him firm hold; yet he travelled but
slowly, and could not always save himself from a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">glissade</i> backwards, and a bruise upon some projecting
knob or crag. Sometimes, upright fronts of ice
diverted him for long circuits, or a broken wall of cold
cliff arose, which he must surmount painfully. Once
or twice he stuck fast in a crevice, and hardly drew
himself out by placing his bundle of picks across the
crack. As he plodded and floundered thus deviously
and toilsomely upward, at last the wasted moon gan
pale overhead, and under foot the snow grew rosy
with coming dawn. The dim world about the mountain's
base displayed something of its vast detail.
He could see, more positively than by moonlight, the
far-reaching arteries of mist marking the organism
of Whulge beneath; and what had been but a black
chaos now revealed itself into the Alpine forest whence
he had come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"But he troubled himself little with staring about;
up he looked, for the summit was at hand. To win
that summit was wellnigh the attainment of his hopes,
if Tamanoüs were true; and that, with the flush of
morning ardor upon him, he could not doubt. There,
in a spot Tamanoüs had revealed to him, was hiaqua,&mdash;hiaqua
that should make him the richest and greatest
of all the Squallyamish.</p>

<p>"The chill before sunrise was upon him as he reached
the last curve of the dome. Sunrise and he struck the
summit together. Together sunrise and he looked
over the glacis. They saw within a great hollow all
covered with the whitest of snow, save at the centre,
where a black lake lay deep in a well of purple rock.</p>

<p>"At the eastern end of this lake was a small, irregular
plain of snow, marked by three stones like monuments.
Towards these the miser sprang rapidly, with
full sunshine streaming after him over the snows.</p>

<p>"The first monument he examined with keen looks.
It was tall as a giant man, and its top was fashioned
into the grotesque likeness of a salmon's head. He
turned from this to inspect the second. It was of
similar height, but bore at its apex an object in shape
like the regular flame of a torch. As he approached,
he presently discovered that this was an image of the
kamas-bulb in stone. These two semblances of prime
necessities of Indian life delayed him but an instant,
and he hastened on to the third monument, which stood
apart on a perfect level. The third stone was capped
by something he almost feared to behold, lest it should
prove other than his hopes. Every word of Tamanoüs
had thus far proved veritable; but might there not be
a bitter deceit at the last? The miser trembled.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tamanoüs was trustworthy. The third monument
was as the old man anticipated. It was a stone
elk's head, such as it appears in earliest summer, when
the antlers are sprouting lustily under their rough
jacket of velvet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"You remember, Boston tyee," continued Hamitchou,
"that Elk was the old man's tamanoüs, the
incarnation for him of the universal Tamanoüs. He
therefore was right joyous at this good omen of protection;
and his heart grew big and swollen with hope,
as the black salmon-berry swells in a swamp in June.
He threw down his 'ikta'; every impediment he laid
down upon the snow; and, unwrapping his two picks
of elk-horn, he took the stoutest, and began to dig
in the frozen snow at the foot of the elk-head monument.</p>

<p>"No sooner had he struck the first blow than he
heard behind him a sudden puff, such as a seal makes
when it comes to the surface to breathe. Turning
round much startled, he saw a huge otter just clambering
up over the edge of the lake. The otter paused,
and struck on the snow with his tail, whereupon another
otter and another appeared, until, following their
leader in slow and solemn file, were twelve other
otters, marching toward the miser. The twelve approached,
and drew up in a circle around him. Each
was twice as large as any otter ever seen. Their
chief was four times as large as the most gigantic otter
ever seen in the regions of Whulge, and certainly was
as great as a seal. When the twelve were arranged,
their leader skipped to the top of the elk-head stone,
and sat there between the horns. Then the whole
thirteen gave a mighty puff in chorus.</p>

<p>"The hunter of hiaqua was for a moment abashed
at his uninvited ring of spectators. But he had seen
otter before, and bagged them. These he could not
waste time to shoot, even if a phalanx so numerous
were not formidable. Besides, they might be tamanoüs.
He took to his pick and began digging stoutly.</p>

<p>"He soon made way in the snow, and came to solid
rock beneath. At every thirteenth stroke of his pick,
the fugleman otter tapped with his tail on the monument.
Then the choir of lesser otters tapped together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with theirs on the snow. This caudal action produced
a dull, muffled sound, as if there were a vast hollow
below.</p>

<p>"Digging with all his force, by and by the seeker
for treasure began to tire, and laid down his elk-horn
spade to wipe the sweat from his brow. Straightway
the fugleman otter turned, and, swinging his tail,
gave the weary man a mighty thump on the shoulder;
and the whole band, imitating, turned, and, backing
inward, smote him with centripetal tails, until he
resumed his labors, much bruised.</p>

<p>"The rock lay first in plates, then in scales. These it
was easy to remove. Presently, however, as the miser
pried carelessly at a larger mass, he broke his elkhorn
tool. Fugleman otter leaped down, and seizing the
supplemental pick between his teeth, mouthed it over
to the digger. Then the amphibious monster took
in the same manner the broken pick, and bore it round
the circle of his suite, who inspected it gravely with
puffs.</p>

<p>"These strange, magical proceedings disconcerted
and somewhat baffled the miser; but he plucked up
heart, for the prize was priceless, and worked on more
cautiously with his second pick. At last its blows
and the regular thumps of the otter's tails called forth
a sound hollower and hollower. His circle of spectators
narrowed so that he could feel their panting breath
as they bent curiously over the little pit he had dug.</p>

<p>"The crisis was evidently at hand.</p>

<p>"He lifted each scale of rock more delicately. Finally
he raised a scale so thin that it cracked into flakes
as he turned it over. Beneath was a large square
cavity.</p>

<p>"It was filled to the brim with hiaqua.</p>

<p>"He was a millionnaire.</p>

<p>"The otters recognized him as the favorite of Tamanoüs,
and retired to a respectful distance.</p>

<p>"For some moments he gazed on his treasure, taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
thought of his future proud grandeur among the
dwellers by Whulge. He plunged his arm deep as
he could go; there was still nothing but the precious
shells. He smiled to himself in triumph; he had
wrung the secret from Tamanoüs. Then, as he withdrew
his arm, the rattle of the hiaqua recalled him to
the present. He saw that noon was long past, and
he must proceed to reduce his property to possession.</p>

<p>"The hiaqua was strung upon long, stout sinews
of elk, in bunches of fifty shells on each side. Four
of these he wound about his waist; three he hung
across each shoulder; five he took in each hand;&mdash;twenty
strings of pure white hiaqua, every shell large,
smooth, unbroken, beautiful. He could carry no
more; hardly even with this could he stagger along.
He put down his burden for a moment, while he covered
up the seemingly untouched wealth of the deposit
carefully with the scale stones, and brushed snow over
the whole.</p>

<p>"The miser never dreamed of gratitude, never
thought to hang a string from the buried treasure
about the salmon and kamas tamanoüs stones, and
two strings around the elk's head; no, all must be
his own, all he could carry now, and the rest for the
future.</p>

<p>"He turned, and began his climb toward the crater's
edge. At once the otters, with a mighty puff in concert,
took up their line of procession, and, plunging into the
black lake, began to beat the water with their tails.</p>

<p>"The miser could hear the sound of splashing water
as he struggled upward through the snow, now melted
and yielding. It was a long hour of harsh toil and
much backsliding before he reached the rim, and turned
to take one more view of this valley of good fortune.</p>

<p>"As he looked, a thick mist began to rise from the
lake centre, where the otters were splashing. Under
the mist grew a cylinder of black cloud, utterly hiding
the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Terrible are storms in the mountains; but in this
looming mass was a terror more dread than any hurricane
of ruin ever bore within its wild vortexes. Tamanoüs
was in that black cylinder, and as it strode
forward, chasing in the very path of the miser, he
shuddered, for his wealth and his life were in danger.</p>

<p>"However, it might be but a common storm. Sunlight
was bright as ever overhead in heaven, and all
the lovely world below lay dreamily fair, in that afternoon
of summer, at the feet of the rich man, who now
was hastening to be its king. He stepped from the
crater edge and began his descent.</p>

<p>"Instantly the storm overtook him. He was thrown
down by its first assault, flung over a rough bank of
iciness, and lay at the foot torn and bleeding, but
clinging still to his precious burden. Each hand
still held its five strings of hiaqua. In each hand he
bore a nation's ransom. He staggered to his feet
against the blast. Utter night was around him,&mdash;night
as if daylight had forever perished, had never
come into being from chaos. The roaring of the storm
had also deafened and bewildered him with its wild
uproar.</p>

<p>"Present in every crash and thunder of the gale
was a growing undertone, which the miser well knew
to be the voice of Tamanoüs. A deadly shuddering
shook him. Heretofore that potent Unseen had been
his friend and guide; there had been awe, but no terror,
in his words. Now the voice of Tamanoüs was inarticulate,
but the miser could divine in that sound an
unspeakable threat of wrath and vengeance. Floating
upon this undertone were sharper tamanoüs voices,
shouting and screaming always sneeringly, 'Ha, ha,
hiaqua!&mdash;ha, ha, ha!'</p>

<p>"Whenever the miser essayed to move and continue
his descent, a whirlwind caught him, and with much
ado tossed him hither and thither, leaving him at
last flung and imprisoned in a pinching crevice, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
buried to the eyes in a snowdrift, or bedded upside
down on a shaggy boulder, or gnawed by lacerating
lava jaws. Sharp torture the old man was encountering,
but he held fast to his hiaqua.</p>

<p>"The blackness grew ever deeper and more crowded
with perdition; the din more impish, demoniac, and
devilish; the laughter more appalling; and the miser
more and more exhausted with vain buffeting. He
determined to propitiate exasperated Tamanoüs with
a sacrifice. He threw into the black cylinder storm
his left-handful, five strings of precious hiaqua."</p>

<p>"Somewhat long-winded is thy legend, Hamitchou,
Great Medicine-Man of the Squallyamish," quoth I.
"Why didn't the old fool drop his wampum,&mdash;shell
out, as one might say,&mdash;and make tracks?"</p>

<p>"Well, well!" continued Hamitchou; "when the
miser had thrown away his first handful of hiaqua,
there was a momentary lull in elemental war, and he
heard the otters puffing around him invisible. Then
the storm renewed, blacker, louder, harsher, crueller
than before, and over the dread undertone of the voice
of Tamanoüs, tamanoüs voices again screamed, 'Ha,
ha, ha, hiaqua!' and it seemed as if tamanoüs hands,
or the paws of the demon otters, clutched at the miser's
right-handful and tore at his shoulder and waist belts.</p>

<p>"So, while darkness and tempest still buffeted the
hapless old man, and thrust him away from his path,
and while the roaring was wickeder than the roars of
tens and tens of tens of bears when ahungered they
pounce upon a plain of kamas, gradually wounded
and terrified he flung away string after string of hiaqua,
gaining never any notice of such sacrifice, except an
instant's lull of the cyclone and a puff from the invisible
otters.</p>

<p>"The last string he clung to long, and before he
threw it to be caught and whirled after its fellows, he
tore off a single bunch of fifty shells. But upon this,
too, the storm laid its clutches. In the final desperate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
struggle the old man was wounded so sternly that
when he had given up his last relic of the mighty
treasure, when he had thrown into the formless chaos,
instinct with Tamanoüs, his last propitiatory offering,
he sank and became insensible.</p>

<p>"It seemed a long slumber to him, but at last he
awoke. The jagged moon was just paling overhead,
and he heard Skai-ki, the Blue-Jay, foe to magic, singing
welcome to sunrise. It was the very spot whence
he started at morning.</p>

<p>"He was hungry, and felt for his bag of kamas and
pouch of smokeleaves. There, indeed, by his side
were the elk-sinew strings of the bag, and the black
stone pipe-bowl,&mdash;but no bag, no kamas, no kinni
kinnik. The whole spot was thick with kamas plants,
strangely out of place on the mountain-side, and overhead
grew a large arbutus-tree, with glistening leaves,
ripe for smoking. The old man found his hardwood
fire-sticks safe under the herbage, and soon twirled
a light, and, nurturing it in dry grass, kindled a cheery
fire. He plucked up kamas, set it to roast, and laid
a store of the arbutus-leaves to dry on a flat stone.</p>

<p>"After he had made a hearty breakfast of the chestnut-like
kamas-bulbs, and, smoking the thoughtful
pipe, was reflecting on the events of yesterday, he
became aware of an odd change in his condition. He
was not bruised and wounded from head to foot, as
he expected, but very stiff only, and as he stirred, his
joints creaked like the creak of a lazy paddle upon the
rim of a canoe. Skai-ki, the Blue-Jay, was singularly
familiar with him, hopping from her perch in the arbutus,
and alighting on his head. As he put his hand
to dislodge her, he touched his scratching-stick of
bone, and attempted to pass it, as usual, through his
hair. The hair was matted and interlaced into a
network reaching fully two ells down his back. 'Tamanoüs,'
thought the old man.</p>

<p>"Chiefly he was conscious of a mental change. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was calm and content. Hiaqua and wealth seemed to
have lost their charms for him. Tacoma, shining
like gold and silver and precious stones of gayest
lustre, seemed a benign comrade and friend. All the
outer world was cheerful and satisfying. He thought
he had never awakened to a fresher morning. He was
a young man again, except for that unusual stiffness
and unmelodious creaking joints. He felt no apprehension
of any presence of a deputy tamanoüs, sent
by Tamanoüs to do malignities upon him in the lonely
wood. Great Nature had a kindly aspect, and made
its divinity perceived only by the sweet notes of birds
and the hum of forest life, and by a joy that clothed
his being. And now he found in his heart a sympathy
for man, and a longing to meet his old acquaintances
down by the shores of Whulge.</p>

<p>"He rose, and started on the downward way, smiling,
and sometimes laughing heartily at the strange
croaking, moaning, cracking, and rasping of his joints.
But soon motion set the lubricating valves at work,
and the sockets grew slippery again. He marched
rapidly, hastening out of loneliness into society. The
world of wood, glade, and stream seemed to him
strangely altered. Old colossal trees, firs behind which
he had hidden when on the hunt, cedars under whose
drooping shade he had lurked, were down, and lay
athwart his path, transformed into immense mossy
mounds, like barrows of giants, over which he must
clamber warily, lest he sink and be half stifled in the dust
of rotten wood. Had Tamanoüs been widely at work
in that eventful night?&mdash;or had the spiritual change
the old man felt affected his views of the outer world?</p>

<p>"Travelling downward, he advanced rapidly, and
just before sunset came to the prairies where his lodge
should be. Everything had seemed to him so totally
altered, that he tarried a moment in the edge of the
woods to take an observation before approaching his
home. There was a lodge, indeed, in the old spot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
but a newer and far handsomer one than he had left
on the fourth evening before.</p>

<p>"A very decrepit old squaw, ablaze with vermilion
and decked with countless strings of hiaqua and costly
beads, was seated on the ground near the door, tending
a kettle of salmon, whose blue and fragrant steam
mingled pleasantly with the golden haze of sunset.
She resembled his own squaw in countenance, as an
ancient smoked salmon is like a newly-dried salmon.
If she was indeed his spouse, she was many years older
than when he saw her last, and much better dressed
than the respectable lady had ever been during his
miserly days.</p>

<p>"He drew near quietly. The bedizened dame was
crooning a chant, very dolorous,&mdash;like this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'My old man has gone, gone, gone,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My old man to Tacoma, has gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To hunt the elk, he went long ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When will he come down, down, down,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down to the salmon-pot and me?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'He has come from Tacoma down, down, down,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the salmon-pot and thee,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>shouted the reformed miser, rushing forward to supper
and his faithful wife."</p>

<p>"And how did Penelope explain the mystery?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"If you mean the old lady," replied Hamitchou,
"she was my grandmother, and I'd thank you not to
call names. She told my grandfather that he had been
gone many years;&mdash;she could not tell how many,
having dropped her tally-stick in the fire by accident
that very day. She also told him how, in despite of
the entreaties of many a chief who knew her economic
virtues, and prayed her to become mistress of his
household, she had remained constant to the Absent,
and forever kept the hopeful salmon-pot boiling for
his return. She had distracted her mind from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
bitterness of sorrow by trading in kamas and magic
herbs, and had thus acquired a genteel competence.
The excellent dame then exhibited with great complacency
her gains, most of which she had put in the
portable and secure form of personal ornament, making
herself a resplendent magazine of valuable frippery.</p>

<p>"Little cared the repentant sage for such things.
But he was rejoiced to be again at home and at peace,
and near his own early gains of hiaqua and treasure,
buried in a place of security. These, however, he
no longer over-esteemed and hoarded. He imparted
whatever he possessed, material treasures or stores of
wisdom and experience, freely to all the land. Every
dweller by Whulge came to him for advice how to
chase the elk, how to troll or spear the salmon, and
how to propitiate Tamanoüs. He became the Great
Medicine Man of the siwashes, a benefactor to his
tribe and his race.</p>

<p>"Within a year after he came down from his long
nap on the side of Tacoma, a child, my father, was
born to him. The sage lived many years, beloved and
revered, and on his deathbed, long before the Boston
tilicum or any blanketeers were seen in the regions of
Whulge, he told this history to my father, as a lesson
and a warning. My father, dying, told it to me.
But I, alas! have no son; I grow old, and lest this
wisdom perish from the earth, and Tamanoüs be again
obliged to interpose against avarice, I tell the tale to
thee, O Boston tyee. Mayest thou and thy nation
not disdain this lesson of an earlier age, but profit by it
and be wise."</p>

<p>So far Hamitchou recounted his legend without the
palisades of Fort Nisqually, and motioning, in expressive
pantomime, at the close, that he was dry with big
talk, and would gladly wet his whistle.</p>

<blockquote><p>[Chapter VIII, beginning at page 155 of the original
publication, is entitled: "Sowee House&mdash;Loolowcan."]</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>I had not long, that noon of August, from the top
of La Tête, to study Tacoma, scene of Hamitchou's
wild legend. Humanity forbade dalliance. While I
fed my soul with sublimity, Klale and his comrades
were wretched with starvation. But the summit of
the pass is near. A few struggles more, Klale the
plucky, and thy empty sides shall echo less drum-like.
Up stoutly, my steeds; up a steep but little less than
perpendicular, paw over these last trunks of the barricades
in our trail, and ye have won!</p>

<p>So it was. The angle of our ascent suddenly broke
down from ninety to fifteen, then to nothing. We
had reached the plateau. Here were the first prairies.
Nibble in these, my nags, for a few refreshing moments,
and then on to superlative dinners in lovelier spots
just beyond.</p>

<p>Let no one, exaggerating the joys of campaigning,
with Horace's "Militia potior est," deem that there
is no compensating pang among them. Is it a pleasant
thing, O traveller only in dreams, envier of the
voyager in reality, to urge tired, reluctant, and unfed
mustangs up a mountain pass, even for their own good?
In such a case a man, the humanest and gentlest, must
adopt the manners of a brute. He must ply the whip,
and that cruelly; otherwise, no go. At first, as he
smites, he winces, for he has struck his own sensibilities;
by and by he hardens himself, and thrashes
without a tremor. When the cortege arrives at an
edible prairie, gastronomic satisfaction will put Lethean
freshness in the battered hide of every horse.</p>

<p>We presently turned just aside from the trail into an
episode of beautiful prairie, one of a succession along
the plateau at the crest of the range. At this height
of about five thousand feet, the snows remain until
June. In this fair, oval, forest-circled prairie of my
nooning, the grass was long and succulent, as if it
grew in the bed of a drained lake. The horses, undressed,
were allowed to plunge and wallow in the deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
herbage. Only horse heads soon could be seen, moving
about like their brother hippopotami, swimming in
sedges.</p>

<p>To me it was luxury enough not to be a whip for a
time. Over and above this, I had the charm of a
quiet nooning on a bank of emerald turf, by a spring,
at the edge of a clump of evergreens. I took my
luncheon of cold salt pork and doughy biscuit by a
well of brightest water. I called in no proxy of tin
cup to aid me in saluting this sparkling creature, but
stooped and kissed the spring. When I had rendered
my first homage thus to the goddess of the fountain,
Ægle herself, perhaps, fairest of Naiads, I drank
thirstily of the medium in which she dwelt. A bubbling
dash of water leaped up and splashed my visage
as I withdrew. Why so, sweet fountain, which I may
name Hippocrene, since hoofs of Klale have caused me
thy discovery? Is this a rebuff? If there ever was
lover who little merited such treatment it is I. "Not
so, appreciative stranger," came up in other bubbling
gushes the responsive voice of Nature through sweet
vibrations of the melodious fount. "Never a Nymph
of mine will thrust thee back. This sudden leap of
water was a movement of sympathy, and a gentle
emotion of hospitality. The Naiad there was offering
thee her treasure liberally, and saying that, drink as
thou wilt, I, her mother Nature, have commanded
my winds and sun to distil thee fresh supplies, and my
craggy crevices are filtering it in the store-houses, that
it may be offered to every welcome guest, pure and
cool as airs of dawn. Stoop down," continued the
voice, "thirsty wayfarer, and kiss again my daughter of
the fountain, nor be abashed if she meets thee half-way.
She knows that a true lover will never scorn his
love's delicate advances."</p>

<p>In response to such invitation, and the more for
my thirsty slices of pork, I lapped the aerated tipple
in its goblet, whose stem reaches deep into the bubble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
laboratories. I lapped,&mdash;an excellent test of pluck
in the days of Gideon son of Barak;&mdash;and why?
For many reasons, but among them for this;&mdash;he
who lying prone can with stout muscular gullet swallow
water, will be also able to swallow back into position
his heart, when in moments of tremor it leaps into his
throat.</p>

<p>When I had lapped plenteously, I lay and let the
breeze-shaken shadows smooth me into smiling mood,
while my sympathies overflowed to enjoy with my
horses their dinner. They fed like school-boys home
for Thanksgiving, in haste lest the present banquet,
too good to be true, prove Barmecide. A feast of
colossal grasses placed itself at the lips of the breakfastless
stud. They champed as their nature was;&mdash;Klale
like a hungry gentleman,&mdash;Gubbins like a
hungry clodhopper,&mdash;Antipodes like a lubberly oaf.
They were laying in, according to the Hudson's Bay
Company's rule, supply at this meal for five days;
without such power, neither man nor horse is fit to
tramp the Northwest.</p>

<p>I lay on the beautiful verdant bank, plucking now
dextrously and now sinistrously of strawberries, that
summer, climbing late to these snowy heights, had just
ripened. Medical men command us to swallow twice
a day one bitter pill confectioned of all disgust. Nature
doses us, by no means against our will, with many
sweet boluses of delight, berries compacted of acidulated,
sugary spiciness. Nature, tenderest of leeches,&mdash;no
bolus of hers is pleasanter medicament than her
ruddy strawberries. She shaped them like Minié-balls,
that they might traverse unerringly to the cell
of most dulcet digestion. Over their glistening surfaces
she peppered little golden dots to act as obstacles
lest they should glide too fleetly over the surfaces of
taste, and also to gently rasp them into keener sensitiveness.
Mongers of pestled poisons may punch their
pills in malodorous mortars, roll them in floury palms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
pack them in pink boxes, and send them forth to distress
a world of patients:&mdash;but Nature, who if she
even feels one's pulse does it by a gentle pressure of
atmosphere,&mdash;Nature, knowing that her children in
their travels always need lively tonics, tells wind, sun,
and dew, servitors of hers, clean and fine of touch, to
manipulate gay strawberries, and dispose them attractively
on fair green terraces, shaded at parching
noon. Of these lovely fabrics of pithy pulpiness, no
limit to the dose, if the invalid does as Nature intended,
and plucks for himself, with fingers rosy and fragrant.
I plucked of them, as far as I could reach on either side
of me, and then lay drowsily reposing on my couch at
the summit of the Cascade Pass, under the shade of a
fir, which, outstanding from the forest, had changed
its columnar structure into a pyramidal, and had
branches all along its stalwart trunk, instead of a mere
tuft at the top.</p>

<p>In this shade I should have known the tree which
gave it, without looking up,&mdash;not because the sharp
little spicular leaves of the fir, miniatures of that sword
Rome used to open the world, its oyster, would drop
and plunge themselves into my eyes, or would insert
their blades down my back and scarify,&mdash;but because
there is an influence and sentiment in umbrages, and
under every tree its own atmosphere. Elms refine
and have a graceful elegiac effect upon those they
shelter. Oaks drop robustness. Mimosas will presently
make a sensitive-plant of him who hangs his
hammock beneath their shade. Cocoa-palms will infect
him with such tropical indolence, that he will not stir
until frowzy monkeys climb the tree and pelt him away
to the next one. The shade of pine-trees, as any one can
prove by a journey in Maine, makes those who undergo
it wiry, keen, trenchant, inexhaustible, and tough.</p>

<p>When I had felt the influence of my fir shelter, on
the edge of the wayside prairie, long enough, I became
of course keen as a blade. I sprang up and called to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Loolowcan, in a resinous voice, "Mamook chaco cuitan;
make come horse."</p>

<p>Loolowcan, in more genial mood than I had known
him, drove the trio out from the long grass. They
came forth not with backward hankerings, but far
happier quadrupeds than when they climbed the pass
at noon. It was a pleasure now to compress with
the knees Klale, transformed from an empty barrel
with protuberant hoops, into a full elastic cylinder,
smooth as the boiler of a locomotive.</p>

<p>"Loolowcan, my lad, my experienced guide, cur
nesika moosum; where sleep we?" said I.</p>

<p>"Copa Sowee house,&mdash;kicuali. Sowee, olyman
tyee,&mdash;memloose. Sia-a-ah mitlite;&mdash;At Sowee's
camp&mdash;below. Sowee, oldman chief,&mdash;dead. It is
far, far away," replied the son of Owhhigh.</p>

<p>Far is near, distance is annihilated this brilliant day
of summer, for us recreated with Hippocrene, strawberries,
shade of fir and tall snow-fed grass. Down
the mountain range seems nothing after our long
laborious up; "the half is more than the whole."
"Lead on, Loolowcan, intelligent brave, toward the
residence of the late Sowee."</p>

<p>More fair prairies linked themselves along the trail.
From these alpine pastures the future will draw butter
and cheese, pasturing migratory cattle there, when
summer dries the scanty grass upon the macadamized
prairies of Whulge. It is well to remind ourselves
sometimes that the world is not wholly squatted over.
The plateau soon began to ebb toward the downward
slope. Descent was like ascent, a way shaggy and
abrupt. Again the Boston hooihut intruded. My
friends the woodsmen had constructed an elaborate
inclined plane of very knobby corduroy. Klale sniffed
at this novel road, and turned up his nose at it. He
was competent to protect that feature against all the
perils of stumble and fall on the trails he had been
educated to travel, but dreaded grinding it on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
rough bark of this unaccustomed highway. Slow-footed
oxen, leaning inward and sustaining each other,
like two roysterers unsteady after wassail, might
clumsily toil up such a road as this, hauling up stout,
white-cotton-roofed wagons, filled with the babies
and Lares of emigrants; but quick-footed ponies,
descending and carrying light loads of a wild Indian
and an untamed blanketeer, chose rather to whisk
along the aboriginal paths.</p>

<p>As we came to the irregular terraces after the first
pitch, and scampered on gayly, I by and by heard a
welcome whiz, and a dusky grouse (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tetrao obscurus</i>)
lifted himself out of the trail into the lower branches of
a giant fir. I had lugged my double-barrel thus far,
a futile burden, unless when it served a minatory purpose
among the drunken Klalams. Now it became an
animated machine, and uttered a sharp exclamation of
relief after long patient silence. Down came tetrao,&mdash;down
he came with satisfactory thud, signifying
pounds of something not pork for supper. We bagged
him joyously and dashed on.</p>

<p>"Kopet," whispered Loolowcan turning, with a
hushing gesture, "hiu kullakullie nika nanitch;&mdash;halt,
plenty birds I see." He was so eager that from
under his low brows and unkempt hair his dusky eyes
glared like the eyes of wild beast, studying his prey
from a shadowy lair.</p>

<p>Dismounting, I stole forward with assassin intent,
and birds, grouse, five noble ones I saw, engaged in
fattening their bodies for human solace and support.
I sent a shot among them. There was a flutter among
the choir,&mdash;one fluttered not. At the sound of my
right barrel one bird fell without rising; another rose
and fell at a hint from the sinister tube. The surviving
trio were distracted by mortal terror. They flew
no farther than a dwarf tree hard by. I drew my
revolver, thinking that there might not be time to
load, and fired in a hurry at the lowermost.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hyas tamanoüs!" whispered Loolowcan, when
no bird fell or flew,&mdash;"big magic," it seemed to the
superstitious youth. Often when sportsmen miss,
they claim that their gun is bewitched, and avail
themselves of the sure silver bullet.</p>

<p>A second ball, passing with keener aim through the
barrel, attained its mark. Grouse third shook off his
mortal remains, and sped to heaven. The two others,
contrary to rule, for I had shot the lower, fled, cowardly
carrying their heavy bodies to die of cold, starvation,
or old age. "The good die first,"&mdash;ay, Wordsworth!
among birds this is verity; for the good are the fat,
who, because of their avoirdupois, lag in flight, or
alight upon lower branches and are easiest shot.</p>

<p>Loolowcan bagged my three trophies and added
them to the first. Henceforth the thought of a grouse
supper became a fixed idea with me. I dwelt upon it
with even a morbid appetite. I rehearsed, in prophetic
mood, the scene of plucking, the scene of roasting,
that happy festal scene of eating. So immersed
did I become in gastronomic revery, that I did not mind
my lookout, as I dashed after Loolowcan, fearless and
agile cavalier. A thrust awoke me to a sense of passing
objects, a very fierce, lance-like thrust, full at my
life. A wrecking snag of harsh dead wood, that projected
up in the trail, struck me, and tore me half off
my horse, leaving me jerked, scratched, disjointed, and
shuddering. Pachydermatous leggins of buckskin, at
cost of their own unity, had saved me from impalement.
Some such warning is always preparing for
the careless.</p>

<p>I soon had an opportunity to propitiate Nemesis by
a humane action. A monstrous trunk lay across the
trail. Loolowcan, reckless steeplechaser, put his horse
at it, full speed. Gubbins, instead of going over
neatly, or scrambling over cat-like, reared rampant
and shied back, volte face. I rode forward to see
what fresh interference of Tamanoüs was here,&mdash;nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
tamanoüs but an unexpected sorry object of
a horse. A wretched castaway, probably abandoned
by the exploring party, or astray from them, essaying
to leap the tree, had fallen back beneath the trunk
and branches, and lay there entangled and perfectly
helpless. We struggled to release him. In vain. At
last a thought struck me. We seized the poor beast
by his tail, fortunately a tenacious member, and,
heaving vigorously, towed him out of prison.</p>

<p>He tottered forlornly to his feet, looking about him
like one risen from the dead. "How now, Caudal?"
said I, baptizing him by the name of the part that
saved his life; "canst thou follow toward fodder?"
He debated the question with himself awhile. Solitary
confinement of indefinite length, in a cramped
posture, had given the poor skeleton time to consider
that safety from starvation is worth one effort more.
He found that there was still a modicum of life and its
energy within his baggy hide. My horses seemed to
impart to him some of their electricity, and he staggered
on droopingly. Lucky Caudal, if life is worth
having, that on that day, of all days, I should have
arrived to rescue him. Strange deliverances for body
and soul come to the dying. Fate sends unlooked-for
succor, when horses or men despair.</p>

<p>Luckily for Caudal, the weak-kneed and utterly dejected,
Sowee's prairie was near,&mdash;near was the
prairie of Sowee, mighty hunter of deer and elk,
terror of bears. There at weird night Sowee's ghost
was often seen to stalk. Dyspeptics from feather-beds
behold ghosts, and are terrified, but nightwalkers
are but bugbears to men who have ridden from dawn
to dusk of a long summer's day over an Indian trail
in the mountains. I felt no fear that any incubus in
the shape of a brassy-hued Indian chief would sit upon
my breast that night, and murder wholesome sleep.</p>

<p>Nightfall was tumbling down from the zenith before
we reached camp. The sweet glimmers of twilight were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
ousted from the forest, sternly as mercy is thrust from
a darkening heart. Night is really only beautiful so
far as it is not night,&mdash;that is, for its stars, which are
sources of resolute daylight in other spheres, and for
its moon, which is daylight's memory, realized, softened,
and refined.</p>

<p>Night, however, had not drawn the pall of brief
death over the world so thick but that I could see
enough to respect the taste of the late Sowee. When
he voted himself this farm, and became seized of it in
the days of unwritten agrarian laws, and before patents
were in vogue, he proved his intelligent right to suffrage
and seizure. Here in admirable quality were the
three first requisites of a home in the wilderness,
water, wood, and grass. A musical rustle, as we galloped
through, proved the long grass. All around
was the unshorn forest. There were columnar firs
making the Sowee house a hypæthral temple on a
grand scale.</p>

<p>There had been here a lodge. A few saplings of its
framework still stood, but Sowee had moved elsewhere
not long ago. Wake siah memloose,&mdash;not long dead
was the builder, and viator might camp here unquestioned.</p>

<p>Caudal had followed us in an inane, irresponsible way.
Patiently now he stood, apparently waiting for farther
commands from his preservers. We unpacked
and unsaddled the other animals. They knew their
business, namely, to bolt instantly for their pasture.
Then a busy uproar of nipping and crunching was
heard. Poor Caudal would not take the hint. We
were obliged to drive that bony estray with blows out
to the supper-field, where he stood aghast at the appetites
of his new comrades. Repose and good example,
however, soon had their effect, and eight equine jaws
instead of six made play in the herbage.</p>

<p>"Alki mika mamook pire, pe nesika klatawah copa
klap tsuk; now light thou a fire, and we will go find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
water," said Loolowcan. I struck fire,&mdash;fire smote
tinder,&mdash;tinder sent the flame on, until a pyre from
the world's free wood-pile was kindled. This boon of
fire,&mdash;what wonder that men devised a Prometheus
greatest of demigods as its discoverer? Mortals,
shrinking from the responsibility of a high destiny and
dreading to know how divine the Divine would have
them, always imagine an avatar of some one not lower
than a half-god when a gift of great price comes to the
world. And fire is a very priceless and beautiful boon,&mdash;not,
as most know it, in imprisonment, barred with
iron, or in sooty chimneys, or in mad revolt of conflagration,&mdash;but
as it grows in a flashing pyramid out in
camp in the free woods, with eager air hurrying in on
every side to feed its glory. In the gloom I strike metal
of steel against metallic flint. From this union a
child is born. I receive the young spark tenderly in
warm "tipsoo," in a soft woolly nest of bark or grass
tinder. Swaddled in this he thrives. He smiles;
he chuckles; he laughs; he dances about, does my
agile nursling. He will soon wear out his first infantile
garb, so I cover him up in shelter. I feed him with
digestible viands, according to his years. I give him
presently stouter fare, and offer exhilarating morsels
of fatness. All these the hearty youth assimilates,
and grows healthily. And now I educate him to manliness,
training him on great joints, shoulders, and
marrowy portions. He becomes erelong a power and
a friend able to requite me generously for my care.
He aids me in preparing my feast, and we feast together.
Afterward we talk,&mdash;Flame and I,&mdash;we
think together strong and passionate thoughts of
purpose and achievement. These emotions of manhood
die away, and we share pensive memories of
happiness missed, or disdained, or feebly grasped and
torn away; regrets cover these like embers, and slowly
over dead fieriness comes a robe of ashy gray.</p>

<p>Fire in the forest is light, heat, and cheer. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
ours was nurtured to the self-sustaining point, we
searched to find where the sage Sowee kept his potables.
Carefully covered up in sedges was a slender
supply of water, worth concealing from vulgar dabblers.
Its diamond drops were hidden away so thoroughly
that we must mine for them by torchlight. I held a
flaring torch, while Loolowcan lay in wait for the
trickle, and captured it in a tin pot. How wild he
looked, that youth so frowzy by daylight, as, stooping
under the tall sedges, he clutched those priceless
sparkles.</p>

<p>Upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte du jour</i> at Restaurant Sowee was
written Grouse. "How shall we have them?" said
I, cook and convive, to Loolowcan, marmiton and
convive. "One of these cocks of the mountain shall
be fried, since gridiron is not," said I to myself, after
meditation. "Two shall be spitted, and roasted;
and, as Azrael may not want us before breakfast to-morrow,
the fourth shall go on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte de dejeuner</i>."</p>

<p>"O Pork! what a creature thou art!" continued I, in
monologue, cutting neat slices of that viand with my
bowie-knife, and laying them fraternally, three in a
bed, in the frying-pan. "Blessed be Moses! who
forbade thee to the Jews, whereby we, of freer dispensations,
heirs of all the ages, inherit also pigs more
numerous and bacon cheaper. O Pork! what could
campaigners do without thy fatness, thy leanness,
thy saltness, thy portableness?"</p>

<p>Here Loolowcan presented me the three birds
plucked featherless as Plato's man. The two roasters
we planted carefully on spits before a sultry spot of
the fire. From a horizontal stick, supported on forked
stakes, we suspended by a twig over each roaster an
automatic baster, an inverted cone of pork, ordained
to yield its spicy juices to the wooing flame, and drip
bedewing on each bosom beneath. The roasters
ripened deliberately, while keen and quick fire told
upon the fryer, the first course of our feast. Meanwhile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I brewed a pot of tea, blessing Confucius for that
restorative weed, as I had blessed Moses for his abstinence
from porkers.</p>

<p>Need I say that the grouse was admirable, that
everything was delicious, and the Confucian weed first
chop? Even a scouse of mouldy biscuit met the approval
of Loolowcan. Feasts cooked under the greenwood
tree, and eaten by their cooks after a triumphant
day of progress, are sweeter than the conventional
banquets of languid Christendom. After we had paid
our duty to the brisk fryer and the rotund roaster
grouse, nothing remained but bones to propitiate
Sowee, should he find short commons in Elysium, and
wander back to his lodge, seeking what he might
devour.</p>

<p>All along the journey I had been quietly probing
the nature of Loolowcan, my most intimate associate
thus far among the unalloyed copper-skins. Chinook
jargon was indeed but a blunt probe, yet perhaps delicate
enough to follow up such rough bits of conglomerate
as served him for ideas. An inductive philosopher,
tracing the laws of developing human thought
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in corpore viti</i> of a frowzy savage, finds his work simple,&mdash;the
nuggets are on the surface. Those tough
pebbles known to some metaphysicians as innate
ideas, can be studied in Loolowcan in their process of
formation out of instincts.</p>

<p>Number one is the prize number in Loolowcan's
lottery of life. He thinks of that number; he dreams
of it alone. When he lies down to sleep, he plots
what he will do in the morning with his prize and his
possession; when he wakes, he at once proceeds to
execute his plots. Loolowcan knows that there are
powers out of himself; rights out of himself he does
not comprehend, or even conceive. I have thus far
been very indulgent to him, and treated him republicanly,
mindful of the heavy mesne profits for the occupation
of a continent, and the uncounted arrears of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
blood-money owed by my race to his; yet I find no
trace of gratitude in my analysis of his character.
He seems to be composed, selfishness, five hundred
parts;&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nil admirari</i> coolness, five hundred parts;&mdash;a
well-balanced character, and perhaps one not likely
to excite enthusiasm in others. I am a steward to
him; I purvey him also a horse; when we reach the
Dalles, I am to pay him for his services;&mdash;but he is
bound to me by no tie of comradery. He has caution
more highly developed than any quadruped I
have met, and will not offend me lest I should resign
my stewardship, retract Gubbins, refuse payment,
discharge my guide, and fight through the woods,
where he sees I am no stranger, alone. He certainly
merits a "teapot" for his ability in guidance. He
has memory and observation unerring; not once in
all our intricate journey have I found him at fault in
any fact of space or time. He knows "each lane and
every ally green" here, accurately as Comus knew his
"wild wood."</p>

<p>Moral conceptions exist only in a very limited degree
for this type of his race. Of God he knows somewhat
less than the theologians; that is, he is in the primary
condition of uninquisitive ignorance, not in the secondary,
of inquisitive muddle. He has the advantage
of no elaborate system of human inventions to unlearn.
He has no distinct fetichism. None of the North
American Indians have, in the accurate sense of the
term; their nomad life and tough struggle with instructive
Nature in her roughness save them from such
elaborate fetichism as may exist in more indolent climes
and countries.</p>

<p>Loolowcan has his tamanoüs. It is Talipus, the
Wolf, a "hyas skookoom tamanoüs, a very mighty
demon," he informs me. He does not worship it;
that would interfere with his devotions to his real
deity, Number One. It, in return, does him little
service. If he met Talipus, object of his superstition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
on a fair morning, he would think it a good omen; if
on a sulky morning, he might be somewhat depressed,
but would not on that account turn back, as a Roman
brave would have done on meeting the matinal wolf.
In fact, he keeps Talipus, his tamanoüs, as a kind of
ideal hobby, very much as a savage civilized man entertains
a pet bulldog or a tame bear, a link between
himself and the rude, dangerous forces of nature.
Loolowcan has either chosen his protector according
to the law of likeness, or, choosing it by chance, has
become assimilated to its characteristics. A wolfish
youth is the <i>protégé</i> of Talipus,&mdash;an unfaithful,
sinister, cannibal-looking son of a horse-thief. Wolfish
likewise is his appetite; when he asks me for more
dinner, and this without stint or decorum he does, he
glares as if, grouse failing, pork and hard-tack gone,
he could call to Talipus to send in a pack of wolves
incarnate, and pounce with them upon me. A pleasant
companion this for lamb-like me to lie down beside in
the den of the late Sowee. Yet I do presently, after
supper and a pipe, and a little jargoning in Chinook
with my Wolf, roll into my blankets, and sleep vigorously,
lulled by the gratifying noise of my graminivorous
horses cramming themselves with material for
leagues of lope to-morrow.</p>

<p>No shade of Sowee came to my slumbers with warning
against the wolf in guise of a Klickatat brave. I
had no ghostly incubus to shake off, but sprang up
recreate in body and soul. Life is vivid when it thus
awakes. To be is to do.</p>

<p>And to-day much is to be done. Long leagues
away, beyond a gorge of difficulty, is the open rolling
hill country, and again far beyond are the lodges of the
people of Owhhigh. "To-day," said Loolowcan, "we

fat, and kick. Klale, the Humorous, kicks playfully,
elongating in preparatory gymnastics. Gubbins, the
average horse, kicks calmly at his saddler, merely as a
protest. Antipodes, the spiteful Blunderer, kicks in
a revolutionary manner, rolls under his pack-saddle,
and will not budge without maltreatment. Ill-educated
Antipodes views mankind only as excoriators
of his back, and general flagellants. Klickitats kept
him raw in flesh and temper; under me his physical
condition improves; his character is not yet affected.</p>

V. FIRST ATTEMPTED ASCENT, 1857<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> LIEUTENANT A. V. KAUTZ, U.S.A.</small></h2>

<blockquote><p class="hang">August Valentine Kautz was born at Ispringen, Baden, Germany,
on January 5, 1828. In that same year his parents
came to America. On attaining manhood the son entered the
army and served as a private soldier in the Mexican War.
At its conclusion he was appointed to the Military Academy
at West Point. Graduating in 1852, he was assigned to the
Fourth Infantry and soon found himself in the Pacific Northwest.
After going through the Indian wars here he achieved
a brilliant record in the Civil War. Continuing in the army,
he reached the rank of brigadier-general and was for a time
in command of the Department of the Columbia. He died
at Seattle on September 4, 1895.</p>

<p class="hang">It was while, as a lieutenant, he was stationed at Fort Steilacoom
that he attempted to ascend Mount Rainier. His account of
the trip was published in the Overland Monthly, May, 1875.
It is here republished by permission of the editor. While
the ascent was claimed to be complete the climber says there
was still higher land above him, and it is now difficult to fix
the exact altitude attained.</p>

<p class="hang">Professor I. C. Russell declares that Professor George Davidson
made a statement before the California Academy of Sciences,
on March 6, 1871, to the effect that when Lieutenant Kautz
"attempted the ascent of Mount Rainier in 1857" he found his
way barred by a great glacier. From this, says Professor
Russell, it "seems that he first reported the existence of living
glaciers in the United States." (See: Israel C. Russell:
Glaciers of North America; Boston, Ginn &amp; Company, 1897,
p. 62). The portrait of General Kautz was furnished by his
daughter, Mrs. Navana Kautz Simpson, of Cincinnati, Ohio.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the summer of 1857 I was stationed at Fort
Steilacoom, Washington Territory. This post was
located near the village of Steilacoom, on the waters
of Puget Sound. The post and the village took their
names from a little stream near by, which is the outlet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of a number of small lakes and ponds emptying into
the sound. Quite a family of Indians made their
permanent home in the vicinity of this creek in former
years, and were known as "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Steilacoom Tillicum</i>."
According to the Indian pronunciation of the name it
should have been spelled "Steelacoom," dwelling long
on the first syllable.</p>

<p>I was at that time a first-lieutenant, young, and fond
of visiting unexplored sections of the country, and
possessed of a very prevailing passion for going to the
tops of high places. My quarters fronted Mount
Rainier, which is about sixty miles nearly east of Fort
Steilacoom in an air line. On a clear day it does not
look more than ten miles off, and looms up against the
eastern sky white as the snow with which it is covered,
with a perfectly pyramidal outline, except at
the top, which is slightly rounded and broken. It is
a grand and inspiring view, and I had expressed so
often my determination to make the ascent, without
doing it, that my fellow-officers finally became incredulous,
and gave to all improbable and doubtful
events a date of occurrence when I should ascend Mount
Rainier.</p>

<p>My resolution, however, took shape and form about
the first of July. Nearly all the officers had been very
free to volunteer to go with me as long as they felt
certain I was not going; but when I was ready to go,
I should have been compelled to go alone but for the
doctor, who was on a visit to the post from Fort Bellingham.</p>

<p>I made preparations after the best authorities I
could find, from reading accounts of the ascent of
Mont Blanc and other snow mountains. We made
for each member of the party an <i>alpenstock</i> of dry ash
with an iron point. We sewed upon our shoes an extra
sole, through which were first driven four-penny nails
with the points broken off and the heads inside. We
took with us a rope about fifty feet long, a hatchet, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
thermometer, plenty of hard biscuit, and dried beef
such as the Indians prepare.</p>

<p>Information relating to the mountain was exceedingly
meagre; no white man had ever been near it,
and Indians were very superstitious and afraid of it.
The southern slope seemed the least abrupt, and in
that direction I proposed to reach the mountain;
but whether to keep the high ground, or follow some
stream to its source, was a question. Leshi, the chief
of the Nesquallies, was at that time in the guard-house,
awaiting his execution, and as I had greatly
interested myself to save him from his fate, he volunteered
the information that the valley of the
Nesqually River was the best approach after getting
above the falls. He had some hope that I would take
him as a guide; but finding that out of the question
he suggested Wah-pow-e-ty,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> an old Indian of the
Nesqually tribe, as knowing more about the Nesqually
than any other of his people.</p>

<p>Mount Rainier is situated on the western side of the
Cascade Range, near the forty-seventh parallel. The
range to which it belongs averages about 7,000 to 8,000
feet in height, and snow may be seen along its summit-level
the year round, while Rainier, with its immense
covering of snow, towers as high again above the
range. In various travels and expeditions in the territory,
I had viewed the snow-peaks of this range
from all points of the compass, and since that time
having visited the mountain regions of Europe, and
most of those of North America, I assert that Washington
Territory contains mountain scenery in quantity and
quality sufficient to make half a dozen Switzerlands,
while there is on the continent none more grand and
imposing than is presented in the Cascade Range
north of the Columbia River.</p>

<p>About noon on the 8th of July [1857] we finally
started. The party consisted of four soldiers&mdash;two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of them equipped to ascend the mountain, and the
other two to take care of our horses when we should
be compelled to leave them. We started the soldiers
on the direct route, with orders to stop at Mr. Wren's,
on the eastern limit of the Nesqually plains, ten or
twelve miles distant, and wait for us, while the doctor
and I went by the Nesqually Reservation in order to
pick up old Wah-pow-e-ty, the Indian guide.</p>

<p>We remained all night at Wren's, and the next morning
entered that immense belt of timber with which
the western slope of the Cascade Range is covered
throughout its entire length. I had become familiar
with the Indian trail that we followed, the year previous,
in our pursuit of Indians. The little patches
of prairie are so rare that they constitute in that immense
forest landmarks for the guidance of the traveler.
Six miles from Wren's we came to Pawhtummi, a little
<i>camas</i> prairie about 500 yards long, and 100 in breadth,
a resort for the Indians in the proper season to gather
the <i>camas</i>-root. Six miles farther we came to a similar
prairie, circular in form, not more than 400 yards in
diameter, called Koaptil. Another six or seven miles
took us to the Tanwut, a small stream with a patch of
prairie bordering it, where the trail crossed. Ten or
twelve miles more brought us to the Mishawl Prairie,
where we camped for the night, this being the end of
the journey for our horses, and the limit of our knowledge
of the country.</p>

<p>This prairie takes its name from the stream near
by, and is situated between it and the Owhap on a
high table-land or bluff, not more than one or two
miles from where these enter the Nesqually. It is
perhaps half a mile long, and 200 or 300 yards wide
at the widest point. The grass was abundant, and
it was an excellent place to leave our horses. Fifteen
months before, I had visited this spot, and camped
near by with a small detachment of troops, searching
for Indians who had hidden away in these forests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
completely demoralized and nearly starving. A family
of two or three men, and quite a number of women and
children, had camped in the fork of the Mishawl and
Nesqually, about two miles from this prairie, and were
making fishtraps to catch salmon. When we fell in
with them we learned that the Washington Territory
volunteers had been before us, and with their immensely
superior force had killed the most of them
without regard to age or sex. Our own little command
in that expedition captured about thirty of these
poor, half-starved, ignorant creatures, and no act of
barbarity was perpetrated by us to mar the memory
of that success.</p>

<p>We accordingly camped in the Mishawl Prairie.
When I was here before it was in March, and the rainy
season was still prevailing; the topographical engineer
of the expedition and I slept under the same blankets
on a wet drizzly night, and next morning treated each
other to bitter reproaches for having each had more
than his share of the covering. Now the weather was
clear and beautiful, and the scene lovely in comparison.
I can imagine nothing more gloomy and cheerless than
a fir-forest in Washington Territory on a rainy winter
day. The misty clouds hang down below the tops of
the tallest trees, and although it does not rain, but
drizzles, yet it is very wet and cold, and penetrates
every thread of clothing to the skin. The summers of
this region are in extraordinary contrast with the
winters. Clear, beautiful, and dry, they begin in May
and last till November; while in the winter, although
in latitude 47° and 48°, it rarely freezes or snows&mdash;often,
however, raining two weeks without stopping
a permeating drizzle.</p>

<p>On this 9th of July, 1857, the weather was beautiful;
it had not rained for weeks. The Mishawl&mdash;a
raging mountain torrent, when last I saw it&mdash;was
now a sluggish rivulet of clear mountain-spring water.
We started early on our journey, having made our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
preparations the evening before. We calculated to be
gone about six days. Each member of the party had
to carry his own provisions and bedding; everything
was therefore reduced to the minimum. Each took a
blanket, twenty-four crackers of hard bread, and
about two pounds of dried beef. We took Dogue (a
German) and Carroll (an Irishman) with us; they
were both volunteers for the trip; one carried the
hatchet and the other the rope. I carried a field-glass,
thermometer, and a large-sized revolver. Wah-pow-e-ty
carried his rifle, with which we hoped to
procure some game. The soldiers carried no arms.
Bell and Doneheh were left behind to take care of the
horses and extra provisions, until our return.</p>

<p>We each had a haversack for our provisions, and a
tin canteen for water. The doctor very unwisely filled
his with whisky instead of water. Having sounded
Wah-pow-e-ty as to the route, we learned he had
once been on the upper Nesqually when a boy, with
his father, and that his knowledge of the country was
very limited. We ascertained, however, that we could
not follow the Nesqually at first; that there was a fall
in the river a short distance above the mouth of the
Mishawl, and that the mountains came down so
abrupt and precipitous that we could not follow the
stream, and that the mountain must be crossed first
and a descent made to the river above the fall.</p>

<p>That mountain proved a severer task than we
anticipated. There was no path and no open country&mdash;only
a dense forest, obstructed with undergrowth
and fallen timber. The sun was very hot when it
could reach us through the foliage; not a breath of
air stirred, and after we crossed the Mishawl, not a
drop of water was to be had until we got down to low
ground again. We toiled from early morning until
three o'clock in the afternoon before we reached the
summit. As the doctor had taken whisky instead of
water in his canteen, he found it necessary to apply to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the other members of the party to quench his thirst,
and our canteens were speedily empty. The doctor
sought relief in whisky, but it only aggravated his
thirst, and he poured out the contents of his canteen.
The severe exertion required for the ascent brought on
painful cramps in his legs, and at one time, about the
middle of the day, I concluded that we should be
obliged to leave him to find his way back to camp
while we went on without him; but he made an agreement
with Wah-pow-e-ty to carry his pack for him
in addition to his own, for ten dollars, and the doctor
was thus enabled to go on. Here was an illustration
of the advantage of training. The doctor was large,
raw-boned, and at least six feet high, looking as if he
could have crushed with a single blow the insignificant
old Indian, who was not much over five feet, and did
not weigh more than half as much as the doctor; but,
inured to this kind of toil, he carried double the load
that any of the party did, while the doctor, who was
habituated to a sedentary life, had all he could do,
carrying no load whatever, to keep up with the
Indian.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon we reached the summit of
the first ascent, where we enjoyed, in addition to a
good rest, a magnificent view of the Puget Sound Valley,
with Mount Olympus and the Coast Range for a
background. Here on this summit, too, munching our
biscuit of hard bread and our dried beef, we enjoyed
a refreshing breeze as we looked down on the beautiful
plains of the Nesqually, with its numerous clear and
beautiful little lakes. There was nothing definite
except forest&mdash;of which there was a great excess&mdash;lakes,
and plains of limited area, the sound, and a great
background of mountains. No habitations, farms, or
villages were to be seen; not a sign of civilization or
human life.</p>

<p>After a good rest we pushed on, taking an easterly
course, and keeping, or trying to keep, on the spur of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the mountain; the forest was so thick, however, that
this was next to an impossibility. We were not loth
to go down into ravines in the hope of finding some
water, for we needed it greatly. It was a long time,
and we met with many disappointments, before we
could find enough to quench our thirst. Our progress
was exceedingly slow on account of the undergrowth.
At sundown we camped in the grand old forest, the
location being chosen on account of some water in a
partially dry ravine. The distance passed over from
Mishawl Prairie we estimated at about ten or eleven
miles. On good roads thirty miles would have wearied
us much less.</p>

<p>We started early the next morning, and for a time
tried to keep the high ground, but found it so difficult
that we finally turned down to the right, and came
upon the Nesqually River about the middle of the
afternoon. There was no material difference in the
undergrowth, but there was an advantage gained in
having plenty of water to quench our thirst. We
made about ten miles this day, and camped about sundown.
There seemed nothing but forest before us;
dark, gloomy forest, remarkable for large trees, and
its terrible solitude. But few living things were to
be seen. The Nesqually is a very wide muddy torrent,
fordable in places where the stream is much
divided by islands.</p>

<p>We already here began to suffer from the loss of
appetite, which was to us such a difficulty throughout
the entire trip. Even the four crackers and two ounces
of dried beef, which was our daily limit, we found
ourselves unable to master, and yet so much was
necessary to keep up our strength. I have never
been able to settle in my mind whether this was due
to the sameness of the food or the great fatigue we
underwent.</p>

<p>The third morning we made an early start, and
followed up the stream in almost a due east direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
all day until about five o'clock, when the doctor broke
down, having been unable to eat anything during the
day. With considerable cramming I managed to dispose
of the most of my rations. We kept the north
side of the river, and had no streams to cross; in fact,
there did not appear to be any streams on either side
putting into the river. The valley seemed several
miles in width, densely timbered, and the undergrowth
a complete thicket. Not more than ten miles were
made by us. Just before we stopped for the night, we
passed through a patch of dead timber of perhaps 100
acres, with an abundance of blackberries. Opposite
our camp, on the south side of the river, there was the
appearance of quite a tributary coming in from the
southeast.</p>

<p>We did not get started until about eleven o'clock
on the fourth morning. After cutting up a deer which
Wah-pow-e-ty brought in early in the morning, we
dried quite a quantity of it by the fire. As we anticipated,
it proved of much assistance, for we already saw
that six days would be a very short time in which to
make the trip. By night we reached a muddy tributary
coming in from the north, and evidently having
its source in the melting snows of Rainier. The summit
of the mountain was visible from our camp, and
seemed close at hand; but night set in with promise of
bad weather. The valley had become quite narrow.
Our camp was at the foot of a mountain spur several
thousand feet high, and the river close at hand. The
gloomy forest, the wild mountain scenery, the roaring
of the river, and the dark overhanging clouds, with
the peculiar melancholy sighing which the wind makes
through a fir forest, gave to our camp at this point an
awful grandeur.</p>

<p>On the fifth morning the clouds were so threatening,
and came down so low on the surrounding mountains,
that we were at a loss what course to pursue&mdash;whether
to follow up the main stream or the tributary at our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
camp, which evidently came from the nearest snow.
We finally followed the main stream, which very soon
turned in toward the mountain, the valley growing
narrower, the torrent more and more rapid, and our
progress slower and slower, especially when we were
compelled to take to the timber. We often crossed
the torrent, of which the water was intensely cold, in
order to avoid the obstructions of the forest. Sometimes,
however, the stream was impassable, and then
we often became so entangled in the thickets as almost
to despair of farther advance. Early in the evening we
reached the foot of an immense glacier and camped.
For several miles before camping the bed of the stream
was paved with white granite bowlders, and the mountain
gorge became narrower and narrower. The walls were
in many places perpendicular precipices, thousands of
feet high, their summits hid in the clouds. Vast piles
of snow were to be seen along the stream&mdash;the remains
of avalanches&mdash;for earth, trees, and rocks were intermingled
with the snow.</p>

<p>As it was near night we camped, thinking it best to
begin the ascent in the early morning; besides, the
weather promised to become worse. The foliage of
the pine-trees here was very dense, and on such a
cloudy day it was dark as night in the forest. The
limbs of the trees drooped upon the ground, a disposition
evidently given to them by the snow, which must
be late in disappearing in this region.</p>

<p>We followed thus far the main branch of the Nesqually,
and here it emerged from an icy cavern at the
foot of an immense glacier. The ice itself was of a
dark-blue tinge. The water was white, and whenever
I waded the torrent my shoes filled with gravel
and sand. The walls of this immense mountain gorge
were white granite, and, just where the glacier terminated,
the immense vein of granite that was visible
on both sides seemed to form a narrow throat to the
great ravine, which is much wider both above and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
below. The water seems to derive its color from the
disintegration of this granite.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>We made our camp under a pine of dense foliage,
whose limbs at the outer end drooped near the ground.
We made our cup of tea, and found the water boil at
202° Fahrenheit. Night set in with a drizzling rain, and
a more solitary, gloomy picture than we presented at
that camp it is impossible to conceive. Tired, hungry,
dirty, clothes all in rags&mdash;the effects of our struggles
with the brush&mdash;we were not the least happy; the
solitude was oppressive. The entire party, except
myself, dropped down and did not move unless obliged
to. I went up to the foot of the glacier, and explored
a little before night set in. I also tried to make a
sketch of the view looking up the glacier; but I have
never looked at it since without being forcibly reminded
what a failure it is as a sketch.</p>

<p>On the morning of the sixth day we set out again up
the glacier. A drizzling rain prevailed through the
night, and continued this morning. We had a little
trouble in getting upon the glacier, as it terminated
everywhere in steep faces that were very difficult to
climb. Once up, we did not meet with any obstructions
or interruptions for several hours, although the
slippery surface of the glacier, which formed inclined
planes of about twenty degrees, made it very fatiguing
with our packs. About noon the weather thickened;
snow, sleet, and rain prevailed, and strong winds, blowing
hither and thither, almost blinded us. The surface
of the glacier, becoming steeper, began to be intersected
by immense crevasses crossing our path, often
compelling us to travel several hundred yards to gain a
few feet. We finally resolved to find a camp. But
getting off the glacier was no easy task. We found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that the face of the lateral moraine was almost perpendicular,
and composed of loose stones, sand, and
gravel, furnishing a very uncertain foothold, besides
being about fifty feet high. Wah-pow-e-ty and I finally
succeeded in getting up, and with the aid of the rope
we assisted our companions to do the same. When
we reached the top we were a little surprised to find
that we had to go down-hill again to reach the mountain
side. Here a few stunted pines furnished us fuel
and shelter, and we rested for the remainder of the
day. I explored a little in the evening by ascending
the ridge from the glacier, and discovered that it would
be much the best route to pursue in ascending to the
summit.</p>

<p>When night set in, the solitude of our camp was very
oppressive. We were near the limit of perpetual snow.
The water for our tea we obtained from the melting of
the ice near by. The atmosphere was very different
from what it was below, and singularly clear when not
obstructed by fog, rain, or snow. There were no
familiar objects to enable one to estimate distance.
When I caught a glimpse of the top of Rainier through
the clouds, I felt certain that we could reach it in three
hours. The only living things to be seen were some
animals, with regard to which we still labor under an
error. These little creatures would make their appearance
on the side of the mountain in sight of our
camp, and feed upon herbage that grew on the soil
where the snow left it bare. The moment anyone
stirred from camp, a sound between a whistle and
scream would break unexpectedly and from some unknown
quarter, and immediately all the animals that
were in sight would vanish in the earth. Upon visiting
the spot where they disappeared, we would find a
burrow which was evidently the creatures' home.
Everywhere round the entrance we found great numbers
of tracks, such as a lamb or kid would make. The
animals that we saw were about the size of kids, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
grazed and moved about so much like them, that,
taken in connection with the tracks we saw, we jumped
at once to the conclusion that they were mountain
sheep, of which we all had heard a great deal, but none
of our party had ever seen any. My report of these
animals, which was published in the <i>Washington
Republican</i> on our return, was severely ridiculed by
some of the naturalists who were hunting for undescribed
insects and animals in that country at the
time. We are still at a loss to understand the habits
of the creatures, and to reconcile the split hoofs which
the tracks indicated with their burrow in the earth.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>On the following morning&mdash;the seventh day from
our camp on the Mishawl&mdash;the sky showed signs of
clear weather, and we began the ascent of the main
peak. Until about noon we were enveloped in clouds,
and only occasionally did we get a glimpse of the
peak. Soon after midday we reached suddenly a colder
atmosphere, and found ourselves all at once above
the clouds, which were spread out smooth and even as
a sea, above which appeared the snowy peaks of St.
Helens, Mount Adams, and Mount Hood, looking like
pyramidal icebergs above an ocean. At first we could
not see down through the clouds into the valleys.
Above, the atmosphere was singularly clear, and the reflection
of the sun upon the snow very powerful. The
summit of Rainier seemed very close at hand.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the afternoon the clouds rolled
away like a scroll; in a very short time they had
disappeared, and the Cascade Range lay before us in
all its greatness. The view was too grand and extensive
to be taken in at once, or in the short time we
had to observe. The entire scene, with few exceptions,
was covered with forests, with here and there barren
rocky peaks that rose up out of the ridges; now and
then a mountain lake, much more blue than the sky,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and the Nesqually, winding like a thread of silver
through the dark forests. From the foot of the glacier
for several miles the bed of the river was very white,
from the granite bowlders that covered the bed of the
stream. The water, too, was of a decidedly chalkier
color near its source.</p>

<p>We had no time, however, to study the beauties
that lay before us. We had already discovered that
there was no telling from appearances how far we had
to go. The travel was very difficult; the surface of
the snow was porous in some places, and at each step
we sunk to our knees. Carroll and the Indian gave
out early in the afternoon, and returned to camp. The
doctor began to lag behind. Dogue stuck close to me.
Between four and five o'clock we reached a very difficult
point. It proved to be the crest of the mountain,
where the comparatively smooth surface was much
broken up, and inaccessible pinnacles of ice and deep
crevasses interrupted our progress. It was not only
difficult to go ahead, but exceedingly dangerous; a
false step, or the loss of a foot-hold, would have been
certain destruction. Dogue was evidently alarmed,
for every time that I was unable to proceed, and turned
back to find another passage, he would say, "<i>I guess,
Lieutenant, we petter go pack.</i>"</p>

<p>Finally we reached what may be called the top, for
although there were points higher yet,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the mountain
spread out comparatively flat, and it was much easier
to get along. The soldier threw himself down exhausted,
and said he could go no farther. The doctor
was not in sight. I went on to explore by myself, but
I returned in a quarter of an hour without my hat,
fully satisfied that nothing more could be done. It was
after six o'clock, the air was very cold, and the wind
blew fiercely, so that in a second my hat which it carried
away was far beyond recovery. The ice was forming
in my canteen, and to stay on the mountain at such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a temperature was to freeze to death, for we brought
no blankets with us, and we could not delay, as it
would be impossible to return along the crest of the
mountain after dark. When I returned to where I
had left the soldier, I found the doctor there also, and
after a short consultation we decided to return.</p>

<p>Returning was far easier and more rapid than
going. The snow was much harder and firmer, and
we passed over in three hours, coming down, what required
ten in going up. We were greatly fatigued by
the day's toil, and the descent was not accomplished
without an occasional rest of our weary limbs. In
one place the snow was crusted over, and for a short
distance the mountain was very steep, and required the
skillful use of the stick to prevent our going much
faster than we desired. The soldier lost his footing,
and rolled helplessly to the foot of the declivity, thirty
or forty yards distant, and his face bore the traces of
the scratching for many a day after, as if he had been
through a bramble-bush.</p>

<p>We found the Indian and Carroll in the camp.
The latter had a long story to tell of his wanderings to
find camp, and both stated that the fatigue was too
much for them. There was no complaint on the part
of any of us about the rarity of the atmosphere. The
doctor attributed to this cause the fact that he could
not go but a few yards at a time, near the summit,
without resting; but I am inclined to think this was
due to our exhaustion. My breathing did not seem
to be in the least affected.</p>

<p>We were much disappointed not to have had more
time to explore the summit of the mountain. We had,
however, demonstrated the feasibility of making the
ascent. Had we started at dawn of day we should
have had plenty of time for the journey. From what
I saw I should say the mountain top was a ridge perhaps
two miles in length and nearly half a mile in
width, with an angle about half-way, and depressions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
between the angle and each end of the ridge which
give to the summit the appearance of three small peaks
as seen from the east or west. When viewed from north
or south, a rounded summit is all that can be seen;
while viewed from positions between the cardinal
points of the compass, the mountain generally has the
appearance of two peaks.</p>

<p>The night was very cold and clear after our return.
We had some idea of making another ascent; but an
investigation into the state of our provisions, together
with the condition of the party generally, determined
us to begin our return on the morning of the eighth
day. The two soldiers had eaten all their bread but
one cracker each. The doctor and I had enough left,
so that by a redistribution we had four crackers each,
with which to return over a space that had required
seven days of travel coming. We, of course, expected
to be a shorter time getting back; but let it be ever
so short, our prospect for something to eat was proportionately
much more limited. We had more meat
than bread, thanks to the deer the Indian had killed,
and we depended greatly on his killing more game for
us going back: but this dependence, too, was cut off;
the Indian was snow-blind, and needed our help to
guide him. His groans disturbed us during the night,
and what was our astonishment in the morning to find
his eyelids closed with inflammation, and so swollen
that he looked as if he had been in a free fight and got
the worst of it. He could not have told a deer from a
stump the length of his little old rifle.</p>

<p>Our camp was about 1,000 or 1,500 feet below the
last visible shrub; water boiled at 199°, and, according
to an approximate scale we had with us, this indicated
an elevation of 7,000 feet. We estimated the highest
peak to be over 12,000 feet high. I greatly regretted
not being able to get the boiling-point on the top, but
it was impossible to have had a fire in such a wind as
prevailed round the summit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>As we returned we had more leisure to examine and
clearer weather to see the glacier than we had coming
up. There was no medial moraine; but an icy ridge
parallel to the lateral moraines, and about midway
between them, extending as far as we ascended the
glacier. The lateral moraines were not continuous,
but were interrupted by the walls of the spurs where
they projected into the glacier; between these points
the lateral moraines existed. The glacier sloped away
from the ridge to the moraines, more or less sharply,
and it was no easy matter to get off the ice, owing to
the steepness of the moraine. The ice melted by
reflection from the face of the moraine, and formed a
difficult crevasse between it and the glacier. Bowlders
of every shape and size were scattered over the
face of the glacier. Large ones were propped up on
pinnacles of ice; these were evidently too thick for the
sun to heat through. The small bowlders were sunk
more or less deeply, and surrounded by water in the
hot sun; but they evidently froze fast again at night.</p>

<p>The noise produced by the glacier was startling and
strange. One might suppose the mountain was breaking
loose, particularly at night. Although, so far as
stillness was concerned, there was no difference between
day and night, at night the noise seemed more
terrible. It was a fearful crashing and grinding that
was going on, where the granite was powdered that
whitened the river below, and where the bowlders were
polished and partially rounded.</p>

<p>The great stillness and solitude were also very oppressive;
no familiar sounds; nothing except the
whistle of the animal before mentioned and the noise
of the glacier's motion was to be heard, and if these
had not occurred at intervals the solitude would have
been still more oppressive. We were glad to get down
again to the Nesqually, where we could hear its roar
and see its rushing waters. The other members of
the party were so tired and worn, however, that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
seemed to observe but little, and as we were now on
our homeward way, their thoughts were set only on
our camp on the Mishawl, with its provisions and
promise of rest.</p>

<p>The first day we passed two of the camps we had
made coming up, and reached a point where we remembered
to have seen a great quantity of blackberries.
It was quite dark by the time we reached the
little spot of dead timber&mdash;which seems to be the
favorite haunt of the creeping bramble in this country&mdash;and
to gather our supper of berries we built a
fire at the foot of a large dead tree. Speedily the
flames were climbing to the top of the withered branches,
and casting a cheerful light for a hundred yards round.
But what we found very convenient for gathering berries
proved to be a great annoyance when we wanted to
sleep. During the night we were constantly moving our
place of rest, at first on account of the falling embers,
and finally for fear of the tree itself.</p>

<p>Blackberries are refreshing so far as the palate is
concerned; but they are not very nourishing. We
took our breakfast on them, and continued down the
Nesqually from six in the morning until six in the
evening, traveling slowly because of the difficult undergrowth
and our worn-out and exhausted condition.
We passed another of our camps, and finally stopped
at what evidently had been an Indian camp. The
cedar bark, always to be found in such places, we anticipated
would make a shelter for us in case of rain,
which the clouds promised us.</p>

<p>No rain fell, however, and we resumed our march,
continuing down the river five or six miles farther
than where we first struck it, to a point where the hills
came close up and overhung the water. There we
camped, expecting that an easy march on the morrow
would enable us to reach our camp on the Mishawl.
We ate our last morsel, and the next morning I was
awakened by the conversation of the two soldiers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
They were evidently discussing the subject of hunger,
for the Irishman said: "I've often seen the squaws
coming about the cook-house picking the pitaties out
of the slop-barrel, an' I thought it was awful; but I
giss I'd do it mesilf this mornin'."</p>

<p>The morning of the eleventh day we left the Nesqually
to cross over to the Mishawl, and traveled on
the mountain all day, until we reached the stream at
night completely exhausted. We should have stopped
sooner than we did, but we were almost perishing with
thirst, not having had any water since we left the
Nesqually in the morning. What we took along in
our canteens was exhausted in the early part of the day.
We were not more than two miles from the camp in
the prairie, and notwithstanding that we had had
nothing to eat all day, except a few berries we had
picked by the way, we were so exhausted that we
lay down to sleep as soon as we had quenched our thirst.</p>

<p>We started up-stream the next morning, thinking
we had reached the Mishawl below our camp; but soon
discovering our mistake, we turned down. At this
point the Irishman's heart sunk within him, he was
so exhausted. Thinking we were lost, he wanted to
lie down in the stream and "drownd" himself. He
was assured that we should soon be in camp, and we
arrived there very soon after, before the men left in
charge of the horses were up.</p>

<p>Our first thought was of something to eat. I cautioned
all about eating much at first; but from subsequent
results am inclined to think my advice was not
heeded. I contented myself with a half cracker, a
little butter, and weak coffee; and an hour after, when
I began to feel the beneficial effects of what I had
eaten, I took a little more substantial meal, but refrained
from eating heartily.</p>

<p>After a short rest we caught our horses, and the
doctor and I rode into Steilacoom, where we arrived
after a hard ride late in the afternoon. As we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
approached the post, we met on the road a number of
the inhabitants with whom we were well acquainted,
and who did not recognize us. Nor were we surprised
when we got a glimpse of our faces in a glass. Haggard
and sunburnt, nearly every familiar feature had
disappeared. Since the loss of my hat, my head-dress
was the sleeve of a red flannel shirt, tied into a knot
at the elbow, with the point at the arm-pit for a visor.
Our clothes were in rags; one of the doctor's pantaloon-legs
had entirely disappeared, and he had improvised
a substitute out of a coffee-sack. In our generally
dilapidated condition none of our acquaintances recognized
us until we got to the post. We passed for
Indians until we arrived there, where we were received
by the officers with a shout at our ludicrous appearance.
They were all sitting under the oak-trees in
front of quarters, discussing what had probably become
of us, and proposing means for our rescue, when
we came up.</p>

<p>I felt the effects of the trip for many days, and did
not recover my natural condition for some weeks. The
doctor and I went to the village next morning, where
the people were startled at our emaciated appearance.
We found that the doctor had lost twenty-one pounds
in weight in fourteen days, and I had lost fourteen
pounds in the same time. The doctor, while we were
in the village, was taken with violent pains in his stomach,
and returned to his post quite sick. He did not
recover his health again for three months.</p>

<p>The two soldiers went into the hospital immediately
on their return, and I learned that for the remainder of
their service they were in the hospital nearly all the
time. Four or five years after, Carroll applied to me
for a certificate on which to file an application for a
pension, stating that he had not been well since his
trip to the mountain. The Indian had an attack of
gastritis, and barely escaped with his life after a protracted
sickness. I attribute my own escape from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
lingering illness to the precautions I took in eating when
satisfying the first cravings of hunger, on our return to
camp.</p>

<p>We are not likely to have any competitors in this
attempt to explore the summit of Mount Rainier.
Packwood and McAllister, two citizens of Pierce
County, Washington Territory, explored up the Nesqually,
and crossed over to the head of the Cowlitz
River, and thence by what was called Cowlitz Pass
(since called Packwood Pass), to the east side of the
mountains, searching for a trail to the mining regions
of the upper Columbia. More recently, surveyors in
the employ of the Pacific Railroad Company have been
surveying through the same route for a railway passage.</p>

<p>When the locomotive is heard in that region some
day, when American enterprise has established an ice-cream
saloon at the foot of the glacier, and sherry-cobblers
may be had at twenty-five cents half-way up
to the top of the mountain, attempts to ascend that
magnificent snow-peak will be quite frequent. But
many a long year will pass away before roads are
sufficiently good to induce any one to do what we did
in the summer of 1857.</p>

VI. FIRST SUCCESSFUL ASCENT, 1870<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> GENERAL HAZARD STEVENS</small></h2>

<blockquote><p class="hang">General Hazard Stevens was born at Newport, Rhode Island,
on June 9, 1842. His father was Major General Isaac I.
Stevens, and his mother, Margaret (Hazard) Stevens, was a
granddaughter of Colonel Daniel Lyman of the Revolution.
In 1854 and 1855, while the son was only thirteen years of
age, he accompanied his father, then the first governor of
Washington Territory, on treaty-making expeditions among
the Indian tribes. Later he accompanied his father into the
Union Army as an officer on his father's staff. He was severely
wounded in the same battle where his father was killed while
leading the charge at Chantilly, September 1, 1862.</p>

<p class="hang">Hazard Stevens continued in the army, and at the end of the war
he was mustered out as a brigadier general of volunteers. He
then returned to Washington Territory and went to work to
support his mother and sisters. On August 17, 1870, he and
P. B. Van Trump made the first successful ascent of Mount
Rainier.</p>

<p class="hang">In 1874, he followed the other members of the family back to
Boston where he remained until his mother's death, a few
months ago. He then returned to Puget Sound, and is now a
successful farmer near Olympia.</p>

<p class="hang">His companion on the ascent, P. B. Van Trump, remained in
Washington. For a number of years he was a ranger at
Indian Henry's Hunting Ground in the Mount Rainier National
Park. There he was a quaint and attractive figure to all
visitors. In 1915, he returned East to live among kinsfolk in
New York State.</p>

<p class="hang">The names of both Stevens and Van Trump have been generously
bestowed upon glaciers, creeks, ridges, and cañons within the
Mount Rainier National Park.</p>

<p class="hang">General Stevens prefers to call the mountain Takhoma. The full
account of the ascent was published by him under the title
of "The Ascent of Mount Takhoma" in the Atlantic Monthly
for November, 1876. It is here reproduced by permission of
the editor of that magazine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p class="hang">Mr. Van Trump made several ascents after that first one, and in
1905 General Stevens also made a second ascent. He searched
in vain for the relics he had deposited at the summit thirty-five
years earlier. The rocks that were bare in 1870 were under
snow and ice in 1905.</p></blockquote>


<p>When Vancouver, in 1792, penetrated the Straits
of Fuca and explored the unknown waters of the
Mediterranean of the Pacific, wherever he sailed, from
the Gulf of Georgia to the farthest inlet of Puget
Sound, he beheld the lofty, snow-clad barrier range of
the Cascades stretching north and south and bounding
the eastern horizon. Towering at twice the altitude
of all others, at intervals of a hundred miles there
loomed up above the range three majestic, snowy
peaks that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Like giants stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sentinel enchanted land."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the matter-of-fact spirit of a British sailor of his
time, he named these sublime monuments of nature in
honor of three lords of the English admiralty, Hood,
Rainier, and Baker. Of these Rainier is the central,
situated about half-way between the Columbia River
and the line of British Columbia, and is by far the
loftiest and largest. Its altitude is 14,444 feet, while
Hood is 11,025 feet, and Baker is 10,810 feet high.
The others, too, are single cones, while Rainier, or
Takhoma,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
is an immense mountain-mass with three
distinct peaks, an eastern, a northern, and a southern;
the two last extending out and up from the main central
dome, from the summit of which they stand over
a mile distant, while they are nearly two miles apart
from each other.</p>

<p>Takhoma overlooks Puget Sound from Olympia to
Victoria, one hundred and sixty miles. Its snow-clad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
dome is visible from Portland on the Willamette, one
hundred and twenty miles south, and from the table-land
of Walla Walla, one hundred and fifty miles east.
A region two hundred and fifty miles across, including
nearly all of Washington Territory, part of Oregon,
and part of Idaho, is commanded in one field of vision
by this colossus among mountains.</p>

<p>Takhoma had never been ascended. It was a virgin
peak. The superstitious fears and traditions of the
Indians, as well as the dangers of the ascent, had
prevented their attempting to reach the summit, and
the failure of a gallant and energetic officer, whose courage
and hardihood were abundantly shown during the
rebellion, had in general estimation proved it insurmountable.</p>

<p>For two years I had resolved to ascend Takhoma,
but both seasons the dense smoke overspreading the
whole country had prevented the attempt. Mr. Philomon
Beecher Van Trump, humorous, generous, whole-souled,
with endurance and experience withal, for he
had roughed it in the mines, and a poetic appreciation
of the picturesque and the sublime, was equally eager
to scale the summit. Mr. Edward T. Coleman, an
English gentleman of Victoria, a landscape artist and
an Alpine tourist, whose reputed experience in Switzerland
had raised a high opinion of his ability above the
snow-line, completed the party.</p>

<p>Olympia, the capital of Washington Territory, is
a beautiful, maple-embowered town of some two
thousand inhabitants, situated at the southernmost
extremity of Puget Sound, and west of Takhoma,
distant in an air line seventy-five miles. The intervening
country is covered with dense fir forests, almost
impenetrable to the midday sun, and obstructed with
fallen trees, upturned roots and stumps, and a perfect
jungle of undergrowth, through which the most energetic
traveler can accomplish but eight or nine miles a
day. It was advisible to gain the nearest possible point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
by some trail, before plunging into the unbroken forest.
The Nisqually River, which rises on the southern and
western slopes of Takhoma, and empties into the sound
a few miles north of Olympia, offered the most direct
and natural approach. Ten years before, moreover,
a few enterprising settlers had blazed out a trail across
the Cascade Range, which followed the Nisqually
nearly up to its source, thence deflected south to the
Cowlitz River, and pursued this stream in a northeastern
course to the summit of the range, thus turning
the great mountain by a wide circuit. The best-informed
mountain men represented the approaches on
the south and southeast as by far the most favorable.
The Nisqually-Cowlitz trail, then, seemed much the
best, for the Nisqually, heading in the south and
southwest slopes, and the Cowlitz, in the southeastern,
afforded two lines of approach, by either of which the
distance to the mountain, after leaving the trail, could
not exceed thirty miles.</p>

<p>One August afternoon, Van Trump and I drove out
to Yelm Prairie, thirty miles east of Olympia, and on
the Nisqually River. We dashed rapidly on over
a smooth, hard, level road, traversing wide reaches of
prairie, passing under open groves of oaks and firs,
and plunging through masses of black, dense forest
in ever-changing variety. The moon had risen as we
emerged upon Yelm Prairie; Takhoma, bathed in
cold, white, spectral light from summit to base, appeared
startlingly near and distinct. Our admiration
was not so noisy as usual. Perhaps a little of dread
mingled with it. In another hour we drove nearly
across the plain and turned into a lane which conducted
us up a beautiful rising plateau, crowned with a
noble grove of oaks and overlooking the whole prairie.
A comfortable, roomy house with a wide porch nestled
among the trees, and its hospitable owner, Mr. James
Longmire, appeared at the door and bade us enter.</p>

<p>The next morning we applied to Mr. Longmire for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a guide, and for his advice as to our proposed trip.
He was one of the few who marked out the Nisqually-Cowlitz
trail years ago. He had explored the mountains
about Takhoma as thoroughly, perhaps, as any
other white man. One of the earliest settlers, quiet,
self-reliant, sensible, and kindly, a better counselor
than he could not have been found. The trail, he said,
had not been traveled for four years, and was entirely
illegible to eyes not well versed in woodcraft, and it
would be folly for any one to attempt to follow it who
was not thoroughly acquainted with the country. He
could not leave his harvest, and moreover in three weeks
he was to cross the mountains for a drove of cattle.
His wife, too, quietly discouraged his going. She described
his appearance on his return from previous
mountain trips, looking as haggard and thin as though
he had just risen from a sick-bed. She threw out effective
little sketches of toil, discomfort, and hardship
incident to mountain travel, and dwelt upon the
hard fare. The bountiful country breakfast heaped
before us, the rich cream, fresh butter and eggs, snowy,
melting biscuits, and broiled chicken, with rich, white
gravy, heightened the effect of her words.</p>

<p>But at length, when it appeared that no one else who
knew the trail could be found, Mr. Longmire yielded to
our persuasions, and consented to conduct us as far as
the trail led, and to procure an Indian guide before leaving
us to our own resources. As soon as we returned
home we went with Mr. Coleman to his room to see a
few indispensable equipments he had provided, in order
that we might procure similar ones. The floor was
literally covered with his traps, and he exhibited them
one by one, expatiating upon their various uses. There
was his ground-sheet, a large gum blanket equally serviceable
to Mr. Coleman as a tent in camp and a bathtub
at the hotel. There was a strong rope to which we
were all to be tied when climbing the snow-fields, so
that if one fell into a chasm the others could hold him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
up. The "creepers" were a clumsy, heavy arrangement
of iron spikes made to fasten on the foot with chains and
straps, in order to prevent slipping on the ice. He had
an ice-axe for cutting steps, a spirit-lamp for making
tea on the mountains, green goggles for snow-blindness,
deer's fat for the face, Alpine staffs, needles and thread,
twine, tacks, screws, screwdriver, gimlet, file, several
medical prescriptions, two boards for pressing flowers,
sketching materials, and in fact every article that Mr.
Coleman in his extensive reading had found used or
recommended by travelers. Every one of these he
regarded as indispensable. The Alpine staff was, he
declared, most important of all, a great assistance in
traveling through the woods as well as on the ice;
and he illustrated on his hands and knees how to cross
a crevasse in the ice on two staffs. This interview
naturally brought to mind the characteristic incident
related of Packwood, the mountain man who, as hunter
and prospector, had explored the deepest recesses of the
Cascades. He had been engaged to guide a railroad
surveying party across the mountains, and just as
the party was about to start he approached the chief
and demanded an advance to enable him to buy his
outfit for the trip. "How much do you want?" asked
the chief, rather anxiously, lest Packwood should overdraw
his prospective wages. "Well, about two dollars
and a half," was the reply; and at the camp-fire that
evening, being asked if he had bought his outfit, Packwood,
thrusting his hand into his pocket, drew forth
and exhibited with perfect seriousness and complacency
his entire outfit,&mdash;a jack-knife and a plug of
tobacco.</p>

<p>Half a dozen carriages rattled gayly out of Olympia
in the cool of the morning, filled with a laughing, singing,
frolicking bevy of young ladies and gentlemen. They
were the Takhoma party starting on their adventurous
trip, with a chosen escort accompanying them to their
first camp. They rested several hours at Longmire's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
during the heat of the day, and the drive was then continued
seven miles farther, to the Lacamas, an irregular-shaped
prairie two miles in length by half a mile in
breadth. Here live two of Mr. Longmire's sons.
Their farms form the last settlement, and at the gate
of Mr. Elkane Longmire's house the road ends. A
wooded knoll overlooking the prairie, with a spring of
water at its foot, was selected as the camp-ground.
Some of the party stretched a large sail between the
trees as a tent, others watered and fed the horses, and
others busied themselves with the supper. Two eager
sportsmen started after grouse, while their more practical
companions bought half a dozen chickens, and
had them soon dressed and sputtering over the fire.
The shades of night were falling as the party sat down
on the ground and partook of a repast fit for the Olympians,
and with a relish sharpened by the long journey
and a whole day's fast.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Mr. Longmire arrived in camp
with two mules and a pack-horse, and our mountain
outfit was rapidly made up into suitable bales and
packed upon the horse and one of the mules, the other
mule being reserved for Longmire's own riding. We
assembled around the breakfast with spirits as gay and
appetites as sharp as ever. Then, with many good-bys
and much waving of handkerchiefs, the party broke up.
Four roughly clad pedestrians moved off in single file,
leading their pack animals, and looking back at every
step to catch the last glimpse of the bright garments
and fluttering cambrics, while the carriages drove rapidly
down the road and disappeared in the dark, sullen
forest.</p>

<p>We stepped off briskly, following a dim trail in an easterly
course, and crossing the little prairie entered the timber.
After winding over hilly ground for about three
miles, we descended into the Nisqually bottom and
forded a fine brook at the foot of the hill. For the next
ten miles our route lay across the bottom, and along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the bank of the river, passing around logs, following
old, dry beds of the river and its lateral sloughs, ankle-deep
in loose sand, and forcing our way through dense
jungles of vine-maple. The trail was scarcely visible,
and much obstructed by fallen trees and underbrush,
and its difficulties were aggravated by the bewildering
tracks of Indians who had lately wandered about the
bottom in search of berries or rushes. We repeatedly
missed the trail, and lost hours in retracing our steps
and searching for the right course. The weather was
hot and sultry, and rendered more oppressive by the
dense foliage; myriads of gnats and mosquitoes tormented
us and drove our poor animals almost frantic;
and our thirst, aggravated by the severe and unaccustomed
toil, seemed quenchless. At length we reached
the ford of the Nisqually. Directly opposite, a perpendicular
bluff of sand and gravel in alternate strata
rose to the height of two hundred and fifty feet, its base
washed by the river and its top crowned with firs. The
stream was a hundred yards wide, waist-deep, and very
rapid. Its waters were icy cold, and of a milk-white hue.
This color is the characteristic of glacial rivers. The
impalpable powder of thousands of tons of solid rocks
ground up beneath the vast weight and resistless though
imperceptible flow of huge glaciers, remains in solution
in these streams, and colors them milk-white to the sea.
Leading the animals down the bank and over a wide,
dry bar of cobblestones, we stood at the brink of the
swift, turbulent river, and prepared to essay its passage.
Coleman mounted behind Van Trump on the
little saddle-mule, his long legs dangling nearly to the
ground, one hand grasping his Alpine staff, the other
the neck-rope of the pack-mule, which Longmire bestrode.
Longmire led in turn the pack-horse, behind
whose bulky load was perched the other member of the
party. The cavalcade, linked together in this order,
had but just entered the stream when Coleman dropped
the neckrope he was holding. The mule, bewildered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
by the rush and roar of the waters, turned directly
down-stream, and in another instant our two pack
animals, with their riders, would have been swept away
in the furious rapids, had not Longmire with great
presence of mind turned their erratic course in the
right direction and safely brought them to the opposite
shore. Following the bottom along the river for some
distance, we climbed up the end of the bluff already
mentioned, by a steep zigzag trail, and skirted along its
brink for a mile. Far below us on the right rushed the
Nisqually. On the left the bluff fell off in a steep hillside
thickly clothed with woods and underbrush, and
at its foot plowed the Owhap, a large stream emptying
into the Nisqually just below our ford. Another mile
through the woods brought us out upon the Mishell
Prairie, a beautiful, oval meadow of a hundred acres,
embowered in the tall, dense fir forest, with a grove
of lofty, branching oaks at its farther extremity, and
covered with green grass and bright flowers. It takes
its name from the Mishell River, which empties into the
Nisqually a mile above the prairie.</p>

<p>We had marched sixteen miles. The packs were
gladly thrown off beneath a lofty fir; the animals were
staked out to graze. A spring in the edge of the woods
afforded water, and while Mr. Coleman busied himself
with his pipe, his flask, his note-book, his sketch-book,
and his pouch of multifarious odds and ends, the other
members of the party performed the duties incident to
camp-life: made the fire, brought water, spread the
blankets, and prepared supper. The flags attached to
our Alpine staffs waved gayly overhead, and the sight
of their bright folds fluttering in the breeze deepened
the fixed resolve to plant them on Takhoma's hoary
head, and made failure seem impossible. Mr. Coleman
announced the altitude of Mishell Prairie as eight
hundred feet by barometer. By an unlucky fall the
thermometer was broken.</p>

<p>The march was resumed early next morning. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
we passed the lofty oaks at the end of the little prairie,
"On that tree," said Longmire, pointing out one of the
noblest, "Maxon's company hanged two Indians in the
war of '56. Ski-hi and his band, after many depredations
upon the settlements, were encamped on the Mishell,
a mile distant, in fancied security, when Maxon
and his men surprised them and cut off every soul
except the two prisoners whom they hanged here."</p>

<p>For eight miles the trail led through thick woods,
and then, after crossing a wide "burn," past a number
of deserted Indian wigwams, where another trail from
the Nisqually plains joined ours, it descended a gradual
slope, traversed a swampy thicket and another
mile of heavy timber, and debouched on the Mishell
River. This is a fine, rapid, sparkling stream, knee-deep
and forty feet wide, rippling and dashing
over a gravelly bed with clear, cold, transparent water.
The purity of the clear water, so unlike the yeasty Nisqually,
proves that the Mishell is no glacial river. Rising
in an outlying range to the northwest of Takhoma,
it flows in a southwest course to its confluence with the
Nisqually near our previous night's camp. We unsaddled
for the noon-rest. Van Trump went up the
stream, fishing; Longmire crossed to look out the trail
ahead, and Coleman made tea solitaire.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and Longmire returned. "The trail
is blind," said he, "and we have no time to lose." Just
then Van Trump returned; and the little train was
soon in readiness to resume the tramp. Longmire rode
his mule across the stream, telling us to drive the pack-animals
after him and follow by a convenient log near
by. As the mule attempted to climb a low place in the
opposite bank, which offered an apparently easy exit
from the river, his hind legs sank in a quicksand, he
sat down quickly, if not gracefully, and, not fancying
that posture, threw himself clear under water. His
dripping rider rose to his feet, flung the bridle-rein over
his arm, and, springing up the bank at a more practicable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
point, strode along the trail with as little delay
and as perfect unconcern as though an involuntary
ducking was of no more moment than climbing over a
log.</p>

<p>The trail was blind. Longmire scented it through
thickets of salal, fern, and underbrush, stumbling over
roots, vines, and hollows hidden in the rank vegetation,
now climbing huge trunks that the animals could barely
scramble over, and now laboriously working his way
around some fallen giant and traveling two hundred
yards in order to gain a dozen yards on the course.
The packs, continually jammed against trees and
shaken loose by this rough traveling, required frequent
repacking&mdash;no small task. At the very top of a high,
steep hill, up which we had laboriously zigzagged
shortly after crossing the Mishell, the little packhorse,
unable to sustain the weight of the pack, which had
shifted all to one side, fell and rolled over and over to
the bottom. Bringing up the goods and chattels one
by one on our own shoulders to the top of the hill, we
replaced the load and started again. The course was
in a southerly direction, over high rolling ground of
good clay soil, heavily timbered, with marshy swales at
intervals, to the Nisqually River again, a distance of
twelve miles. We encamped on a narrow flat between
the high hill just descended and the wide and noisy
river, near an old ruined log-hut, the former residence
of a once famed Indian medicine man, who, after the
laudable custom of his race, had expiated with his life
his failure to cure a patient.</p>

<p>Early next morning we continued our laborious
march along the right bank of the Nisqually. Towards
noon we left the river, and after thridding in an easterly
course a perfect labyrinth of fallen timber for six miles,
and forcing our way with much difficulty through the
tangled jungle of an extensive vine-maple swamp, at
length crossed Silver Creek and gladly threw off the
packs for an hour's rest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>A short distance after crossing Silver Creek the trail
emerged upon more open ground, and for the first time
the Nisqually Valley lay spread out in view before us.
On the left stretched a wall of steep, rocky mountains,
standing parallel to the course of the river and extending
far eastward, growing higher and steeper and
more rugged as it receded from view. At the very
extremity of this range Takhoma loomed aloft, its dome
high above all others and its flanks extending far
down into the valley, and all covered, dome and flanks,
with snow of dazzling white, in striking contrast with
the black basaltic mountains about it. Startlingly
near it looked to our eyes, accustomed to the restricted
views and gloom of the forest.</p>

<p>After our noon rest we continued our journey up the
valley, twisting in and out among the numerous trunks
of trees that encumbered the ground, and after several
hours of tedious trudging struck our third camp on
Copper Creek, the twin brother to Silver Creek, just at
dusk. We were thoroughly tired, having made twenty
miles in thirteen hours of hard traveling.</p>

<p>Starting at daylight next morning, we walked two
miles over rough ground much broken by ravines, and
then descended into the bed of the Nisqually at the
mouth of Goat Creek, another fine stream which empties
here. We continued our course along the river bed,
stumbling over rocky bars and forcing our way through
dense thickets of willow, for some distance, then ascended
the steep bank, went around a high hill over
four miles of execrable trail, and descended to the
river again, only two miles above Goat Creek. At
this point the Takhoma branch or North Fork joins
the Nisqually. This stream rises on the west side
of Takhoma, is nearly as large as the main river,
and like it shows its glacial origin by its milk-white
water and by its icy cold, terribly swift and furious
torrent. Crossing the Takhoma branch, here thirty
yards wide, we kept up the main river, crossing and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
recrossing the stream frequently, and toiling over
rocky bars for four miles, a distance which consumed
five hours, owing to the difficulties of the way. We
then left the Nisqually, turning to the right and traveling
in a southerly course, and followed up the bed of a
swampy creek for half a mile, then crossed a level tract
much obstructed with fallen timber, then ascended a
burnt ridge, and followed it for two miles to a small,
marshy prairie in a wide canyon or defile closed in by
rugged mountains on either side, and camped beside
a little rivulet on the east side of the prairie. This was
Bear Prairie, the altitude of which by the barometer
was 2630 feet. The canyon formed a low pass between
the Nisqually and Cowlitz rivers, and the little rivulet
near which we camped flowed into the latter stream.
The whole region had been swept by fire: thousands
of giant trunks stood blackened and lifeless, the picture
of desolation.</p>

<p>As we were reclining on the ground around the campfire,
enjoying the calm and beatific repose which comes
to the toil-worn mountaineer after his hearty supper,
one of these huge trunks, after several warning creaks,
came toppling and falling directly over our camp.
All rushed to one side or another to avoid the impending
crash. As one member of the party, hastily catching
up in one hand a frying-pan laden with tin plates
and cups, and in the other the camp kettle half full of
boiling water, was scrambling away, his foot tripped in
a blackberry vine and he fell outstretched at full length,
the much-prized utensils scattering far and wide,
while the falling tree came thundering down in the rear,
doing no other damage, however, than burying a pair
of blankets.</p>

<p>The following day Longmire and the writer went
down the canyon to its junction with the Cowlitz
River, in search of a band of Indians who usually made
their headquarters at this point, and among whom
Longmire hoped to find some hunter familiar with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
mountains who might guide us to the base of Takhoma.
The tiny rivulet as we descended soon swelled to a
large and furious torrent, and its bed filled nearly the
whole bottom of the gorge. The mountains rose on
both sides precipitously, and the traces of land-slides
which had gouged vast furrows down their sides were
frequent. With extreme toil and difficulty we made
our way, continually wading the torrent, clambering
over broken masses of rock which filled its bed, or clinging
to the steep hillsides, and reached the Cowlitz
at length after twelve miles of this fatiguing work, but
only to find the Indian camp deserted. Further search,
however, was rewarded by the discovery of a rude
shelter formed of a few skins thrown over a framework
of poles, beneath which sat a squaw at work upon
a half-dressed deerskin. An infant and a naked child
of perhaps four years lay on the ground near the fire in
front. Beside the lodge and quietly watching our approach,
of which he alone seemed aware, stood a tall,
slender Indian clad in buckskin shirt and leggings,
with a striped woolen breech-clout, and a singular
head garniture which gave him a fierce and martial appearance.
This consisted of an old military cap, the
visor thickly studded with brassheaded nails, while
a large circular brass article, which might have been the
top of an oil-lamp, was fastened upon the crown. Several
eagle feathers stuck in the crown and strips of fur
sewed upon the sides completed the edifice, which,
notwithstanding its components, appeared imposing
rather than ridiculous. A long Hudson Bay gun,
the stock also ornamented with brass-headed tacks,
lay in the hollow of the Indian's shoulder.</p>

<p>He received us with great friendliness, yet not without
dignity, shaking hands and motioning us to a seat
beneath the rude shelter, while his squaw hastened to
place before us suspicious-looking cakes of dried berries,
apparently their only food. After a moderate indulgence
in this delicacy, Longmire made known our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
wants. The Indian spoke fluently the Chinook jargon,
that high-bred lingo invented by the old fur-traders.
He called himself "Sluiskin," and readily agreed to
guide us to Rainier, known to him only as Takhoma,
and promised to report at Bear Prairie the next day. It
was after seven in the evening when we reached camp,
thoroughly fagged.</p>

<p>Punctual to promise, Sluiskin rode up at noon
mounted upon a stunted Indian pony, while his squaw
and pappooses followed upon another even more puny
and forlorn. After devouring an enormous dinner,
evidently compensating for the rigors of a long fast,
in reply to our inquiries he described the route he proposed
to take to Takhoma. Pointing to the almost
perpendicular height immediately back or east of our
camp, towering three thousand feet or more overhead,
the loftiest mountain in sight, "We go to the top of that
mountain to-day," said he, "and to-morrow we follow
along the high, backbone ridge of the mountains, now
up, now down, first on one side and then on the other,
a long day's journey, and at last, descending far down
from the mountains into a deep valley, reach the base
of Takhoma." Sluiskin illustrated his Chinook with
speaking signs and pantomime. He had frequently
hunted the mountain sheep upon the snow-fields of
Takhoma, but had never ascended to the summit. It
was impossible to do so, and he put aside as idle talk
our expressed intention of making the ascent.</p>

<p>We had already selected the indispensable articles
for a week's tramp, a blanket apiece, the smallest coffee-pot
and frying-pan, a scanty supply of bacon, flour,
coffee, etc., and had made them up into suitable packs
of forty pounds each, provided with slings like a knapsack,
and had piled together under the lee of a huge
fallen trunk our remaining goods. Longmire, who
although impatient to return home, where his presence
was urgently needed, had watched and directed our
preparations during the forenoon with kindly solicitude,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
now bade us good-by: mounted on one mule and leading
the other, he soon disappeared down the trail on
his lonely, homeward way. He left us the little
pack-horse, thinking it would be quite capable of
carrying our diminished outfit after our return from
Takhoma.</p>

<p>Sluiskin led the way. The load upon his shoulders
was sustained by a broad band, passing over his head,
upon which his heavy, brass-studded rifle, clasped in
both hands, was poised and balanced. Leaving behind
the last vestige of trail, we toiled in single file
slowly and laboriously up the mountain all the afternoon.
The steepness of the ascent in many places
required the use of both hand and foot in climbing, and
the exercise of great caution to keep the heavy packs
from dragging us over backwards. Coleman lagged
behind from the start, and at intervals his voice could
be heard hallooing and calling upon us to wait. Towards
sunset we reached a level terrace, or bench, near
the summit, gladly threw off our packs, and waited for
Coleman, who, we supposed, could not be far below.
He not appearing, we hallooed again and again. No
answer! We then sent Sluiskin down the mountain to
his aid. After an hour's absence the Indian returned.
He had descended, he said, a long distance, and at last
caught sight of Coleman. He was near the foot of the
mountain, had thrown away his pack, blankets and all,
and was evidently returning to camp. And Sluiskin
finished his account with expressions of contempt for
the "cultus King George man." What was to be
done? Coleman carried in his pack all our bacon, our
only supply of meat, except a few pounds of dried beef.
He also had the barometer, the only instrument that
had survived the jolts and tumbles of our rough trip.
But, on the other hand, he had been a clog upon our
march from the outset. He was evidently too infirm
to endure the toil before us, and would not only be unable
to reach, still less ascend Takhoma, but might even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
impede and frustrate our own efforts. Knowing that
he would be safe in camp until our return, we hastily
concluded to proceed without him, trusting to our
rifles for a supply of meat.</p>

<p>Sluiskin led us along the side of the ridge in a southerly
direction for two miles farther, to a well-sheltered,
grassy hollow in the mountain-top, where he had often
previously encamped. It was after dark when we
reached this place. The usual spring had gone dry,
and, parched with thirst we searched the gulches of the
mountain-side for water an hour, but without success.
At length the writer, recalling a scanty rill which trickled
across their path a mile back, taking the coffee-pot and
large canteen, retraced his steps, succeeded in filling
these utensils after much fumbling in the dark and consequent
delay, and returned to camp. He found Van
Trump and the Indian, anxious at the long delay,
mounted on the crest of the ridge some two hundred
yards from camp, waving torches and shouting lustily
to direct his steps. The mosquitoes and flies came
in clouds, and were terribly annoying. After supper
of coffee and bread, we drank up the water, rolled ourselves
in our blankets, and lay down under a tree with
our flags floating from under the boughs overhead.
Hot as had been the day, the night was cold and frosty,
owing, doubtless, to the altitude of our camp.</p>

<p>At the earliest dawn next morning we were moving
on without breakfast, and parched with thirst. Sluiskin
led us in a general course about north-northeast,
but twisting to nearly every point of the compass, and
climbing up and down thousands of feet from mountain
to mountain, yet keeping on the highest backbone
between the headwaters of the Nisqually and Cowlitz
rivers. After several hours of this work we came to a
well-sheltered hollow, one side filled with a broad bed
of snow, at the foot of which nestled a tiny, tranquil
lakelet, and gladly threw off our heavy packs, assuaged
our thirst, and took breakfast,&mdash;bread and coffee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
again. Early as it was, the chill of the frosty night still
in the air, the mosquitoes renewed their attacks, and
proved as innumerable and vexatious as ever.</p>

<p>Continuing our march, we crossed many beds of snow,
and drank again and again from the icy rills which
flowed out of them. The mountains were covered with
stunted mountain-ash and low, stubby firs with short,
bushy branches, and occasionally a few pines. Many
slopes were destitute of trees but covered with luxuriant
grass and the greatest profusion of beautiful flowers
of vivid hues. This was especially the case with the
southern slopes, while the northern sides of the mountains
were generally wooded. We repeatedly ate berries,
and an hour afterwards ascended to where berries
of the same kind were found scarcely yet formed. The
country was much obscured with smoke from heavy
fires which had been raging on the Cowlitz the last two
days. But when at length, after climbing for hours
an almost perpendicular peak,&mdash;creeping on hands and
knees over loose rocks, and clinging to scanty tufts of
grass where a single slip would have sent us rolling a
thousand feet down to destruction,&mdash;we reached the
highest crest and looked over, we exclaimed that we
were already well repaid for all our toil. Nothing can
convey an idea of the grandeur and ruggedness of the
mountains. Directly in front, and apparently not over
two miles distant, although really twenty, old Takhoma
loomed up more gigantic than ever. We were far above
the level of the lower snow-line on Takhoma. The high
peak upon which we clung seemed the central core or
focus of all the mountains around, and on every side we
looked down vertically thousands of feet, deep down into
vast, terrible defiles, black and fir-clothed, which
stretched away until lost in the distance and smoke.
Between them, separating one from another, the
mountain-walls rose precipitously and terminated in
bare, columnar peaks of black basaltic or volcanic rock,
as sharp as needles. It seemed incredible that any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
human foot could have followed out the course we came,
as we looked back upon it.</p>

<p>After a few hours more of this climbing, we stood
upon the summit of the last mountain-ridge that separated
us from Takhoma. We were in a saddle of the
ridge; a lofty peak rose on either side. Below us extended
a long, steep hollow or gulch filled with snow,
the farther extremity of which seemed to drop off
perpendicularly into a deep valley or basin. Across
this valley, directly in front, filling up the whole horizon
and view with an indescribable aspect of magnitude
and grandeur, stood the old leviathan of mountains.
The broad, snowy dome rose far among and above the
clouds. The sides fell off in vertical steeps and fearful
black walls of rock for a third of its altitude; lower
down, vast, broad, gently sloping snow-fields surrounded
the mountain, and were broken here and there
by ledges or masses of the dark basaltic rock protruding
above them. Long, green ridges projected from
this snow-belt at intervals, radiating from the mountain
and extending many miles until lost in the distant
forests. Deep valleys lay between these ridges. Each
at its upper end formed the bed of a glacier, which
closed and filled it up with solid ice. Below the snow-line
bright green grass with countless flowers, whose
vivid scarlet, blue, and purple formed bodies of color
in the distance, clothed the whole region of ridges and
valleys, for a breadth of five miles. The beautiful
balsam firs, about thirty feet in height, and of a purple,
dark-green color, stood scattered over the landscape,
now singly, now in groves, and now in long lines, as
though planted in some well-kept park. Farther down
an unbroken fir forest surrounded the mountain and
clad the lower portions of the ridges and valleys. In
every sheltered depression or hollow lay beds of snow
with tiny brooks and rivulets flowing from them. The
glaciers terminated not gradually, but abruptly, with a
wall of ice from one to five hundred feet high, from beneath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
which yeasty torrents burst forth and rushed
roaring and tumbling down the valleys. The principal
of these, far away on our left front, could be seen
plunging over two considerable falls, half hidden in
the forest, while the roar of waters was distinctly audible.</p>

<p>At length we cautiously descended the snow-bed,
and, climbing at least fifteen hundred feet down a
steep but ancient land-slide by means of the bushes
growing among the loose rocks, reached the valley,
and encountered a beautiful, peaceful, limpid creek.
Van Trump could not resist the temptation of unpacking
his bundle, selecting one of his carefully preserved
flies, and trying the stream for trout, but without a
single rise. After an hour's rest and a hearty repast we
resumed our packs, despite Sluiskin's protests, who
seemed tired out with his arduous day's toil and pleaded
hard against traveling farther. Crossing the stream,
we walked through several grassy glades, or meadows,
alternating with open woods. We soon came to the foot
of one of the long ridges already described, and ascending
it followed it for several miles through open woods,
until we emerged upon the enchanting emerald and
flowery meads which clothe these upper regions.
Halting upon a rising eminence in our course, and looking
back, we beheld the ridge of mountains we had
just descended stretching from east to west in a steep,
rocky wall; a little to the left, a beautiful lake, evidently
the source of the stream just crossed, which we called
Clear Creek, and glimpses of which could be seen among
the trees as it flowed away to the right, down a rapidly
descending valley along the foot of the lofty mountain-wall.
Beyond the lake again, still farther to the left,
the land also subsided quickly. It was at once evident
that the lake was upon a summit, or divide, between
the waters of the Nisqually and Cowlitz rivers. The
ridge which we were ascending lay north and south,
and led directly up to the mountain.</p>

<p>We camped, as the twilight fell upon us, in an aromatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
grove of balsam firs. A grouse, the fruit of Sluiskin's
rifle, broiled before the fire, and impartially
divided gave a relish to the dry bread and coffee. After
supper we reclined upon our blankets in front of the
bright, blazing fire, well satisfied. The Indian, when
starting from Bear Prairie, had evidently deemed our
intention of ascending Takhoma too absurd to deserve
notice. The turning back of Mr. Coleman only deepened
his contempt for our prowess. But his views had
undergone a change with the day's march. The affair
began to look serious to him, and now in Chinook,
interspersed with a few words of broken English and
many signs and gesticulations, he began a solemn exhortation
and warning against our rash project.</p>

<p>Takhoma, he said, was an enchanted mountain,
inhabited by an evil spirit, who dwelt in a fiery lake on
its summit. No human being could ascend it or even
attempt its ascent, and survive. At first, indeed, the
way was easy. The broad snow-fields, over which he
had so often hunted the mountain goat, interposed no
obstacle, but above them the rash adventurer would
be compelled to climb up steeps of loose, rolling rocks,
which would turn beneath his feet and cast him head-long
into the deep abyss below. The upper snow-slopes,
too, were so steep that not even a goat, far less
a man, could get over them. And he would have to
pass below lofty walls and precipices whence avalanches
of snow and vast masses of rocks were continually
falling; and these would inevitably bury the intruder
beneath their ruins. Moreover, a furious tempest
continually swept the crown of the mountain, and the
luckless adventurer, even if he wonderfully escaped the
perils below, would be torn from the mountain and
whirled through the air by this fearful blast. And the
awful being upon the summit, who would surely punish
the sacrilegious attempt to invade his sanctuary,&mdash;who
could hope to escape his vengeance? Many
years ago, he continued, his grandfather, a great chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and warrior, and a mighty hunter, had ascended part
way up the mountain, and had encountered some of these
dangers, but he fortunately turned back in time to escape
destruction; and no other Indian had ever gone so far.</p>

<p>Finding that his words did not produce the desired
effect, he assured us that, if we persisted in attempting
the ascent, he would wait three days for our return,
and would then proceed to Olympia and inform our
friends of our death; and he begged us to give him a
paper (a written note) to take to them, so that they
might believe his story. Sluiskin's manner during this
harangue was earnest in the extreme, and he was undoubtedly
sincere in his forebodings. After we had
retired to rest, he kept up a most dismal chant, or dirge,
until late in the night. The dim, white, spectral mass
towering so near, the roar of the torrents below us, and
the occasional thunder of avalanches, several of which
fell during the night, added to the weird effect of Sluiskin's
song.</p>

<p>The next morning we moved two miles farther up the
ridge and made camp in the last clump of trees, quite
within the limit of perpetual snow. Thence, with
snow-spikes upon our feet and Alpine staff in hand, we
went up the snow-fields to reconnoiter the best line of
ascent. We spent four hours, walking fast, in reaching
the foot of the steep, abrupt part of the mountain.
After carefully scanning the southern approaches, we
decided to ascend on the morrow by a steep, rocky
ridge that seemed to lead up to the snowy crown.</p>

<p>Our camp was pitched on a high knoll crowned by a
grove of balsam firs, near a turbulent glacial torrent.
About nine o'clock, after we had lain down for the
night, the firs round our camp took fire and suddenly
burst out in a vivid conflagration. The night was dark
and windy, and the scene&mdash;the vast, dim outlines of
Takhoma, the white snow-fields, the roaring torrent,
the crackling blaze of the burning trees&mdash;was strikingly
wild and picturesque.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>In honor of our guide we named the cascade at our
feet Sluiskin's Falls; the stream we named Glacier
Creek, and the mass of ice whence it derives its source
we styled the Little Nisqually Glacier.</p>

<p>Before daylight the next morning, Wednesday,
August 17, 1870, we were up and had breakfasted,
and at six o'clock we started to ascend Takhoma. Besides
our Alpine staffs and creepers, we carried a long
rope, an ice-axe, a brass plate inscribed with our
names, our flags, a large canteen, and some luncheon.
We were also provided with gloves, and green goggles
for snow-blindness, but found no occasion to use the
latter. Having suffered much from the heat of the
sun since leaving Bear Prairie, and being satisfied from
our late reconnoissance that we could reach the summit
and return on the same day, we left behind our
coats and blankets. In three hours of fast walking
we reached the highest point of the preceding day's
trip, and commenced the ascent by the steep, rocky
ridge already described as reaching up to the snowy
dome. We found it to be a very narrow, steep, irregular
backbone, being solid rock, while the sides were
composed of loose broken rocks and débris. Up this
ridge, keeping upon the spine when possible, and sometimes
forced to pick our way over the loose and broken
rocks at the sides, around columnar masses which we
could not directly climb over, we toiled for five hundred
yards, ascending at an angle of nearly forty-five degrees.
Here the ridge connected, by a narrow neck or saddle,
with a vast square rock, whose huge and distinct outline
can be clearly perceived from a distance of twenty-five
miles. This, like the ridge, is a conglomerate of
basalt and trap, in well-defined strata, and is rapidly
disintegrating and continually falling in showers and
even masses of rocks and rubbish, under the action of
frost by night and melting snow by day. It lies imbedded
in the side of the mountain, with one side and
end projected and overhanging deep, terrible gorges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and it is at the corner or junction of these two faces
that the ridge joined it at a point about a thousand feet
below its top. On the southern face the strata were
inclined at an angle of thirty degrees. Crossing by the
saddle from the ridge, despite a strong wind which swept
across it, we gained a narrow ledge formed by a stratum
more solid than its fellows, and creeping along it, hugging
close to the main rock on our right, laboriously and
cautiously continued the ascent. The wind was blowing
violently. We were now crawling along the face
of the precipice almost in mid-air. On the right the
rock towered far above us perpendicularly. On the
left it fell sheer off, two thousand feet, into a vast abyss.
A great glacier filled its bed and stretched away for
several miles, all seamed or wrinkled across with countless
crevasses. We crept up and along a ledge, not of
solid, sure rock, but one obstructed with the loose stones
and débris which were continually falling from above,
and we trod on the upper edge of a steep slope of this
rubbish, sending the stones at every step rolling and
bounding into the depth below. Several times during
our progress showers of rocks fell from the precipice
above across our path, and rolled into the abyss, but
fortunately none struck us.</p>

<p>Four hundred yards of this progress brought us to
where the rock joined the overhanging edge of the vast
névé or snow-field that descended from the dome of
the mountain and was from time to time, as pressed
forward and downward, breaking off in immense
masses, which fell with a noise as of thunder into the
great canyon on our left. The junction of rock
and ice afforded our only line of ascent. It was an
almost perpendicular gutter, but here our ice-axe came
into play, and by cutting steps in the ice and availing
ourselves of every crevice or projecting point of the
rock, we slowly worked our way up two hundred yards
higher. Falling stones were continually coming down,
both from the rock on our right and from the ice in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
front, as it melted and relaxed its hold upon them. Mr.
Van Trump was hit by a small one, and another struck
his staff from his hands. Abandoning the rock, then,
at the earliest practicable point, we ascended directly
up the ice, cutting steps for a short distance, until we
reached ice so corrugated, or drawn up in sharp pinnacles,
as to afford a foothold. These folds or pinnacles
were about two or three feet high, and half as thick, and
stood close together. It was like a very violent chop
sea, only the waves were sharper. Up this safe footing
we climbed rapidly, the side of the mountain becoming
less and less steep, and the ice waves smaller and more
regular, and, after ascending about three hundred yards,
stood fairly upon the broad dome of mighty Takhoma.
It rose before us like a broad, gently swelling headland
of dazzling white, topped with black, where the rocky
summit projected above the névé. Ascending diagonally
towards the left, we continued our course. The
snow was hard and firm under foot, crisp and light for
an inch or two, but solidified into ice a foot or less
beneath the surface. The whole field was covered
with the ice-waves already described, and intersected
by a number of crevasses which we crossed at narrow
places without difficulty. About half-way up the slope,
we encountered one from eight to twenty feet wide and
of profound depth. The most beautiful vivid emerald-green
color seemed to fill the abyss, the reflection of the
bright sunlight from side to side of its pure ice walls.
The upper side or wall of the crevasse was some twelve
feet above the lower, and in places overhung it, as
though the snow-field on the lower side had bodily
settled down a dozen feet. Throwing a bight of the
rope around a projecting pinnacle on the upper side,
we climbed up, hand over hand, and thus effected a
crossing. We were now obliged to travel slowly, with
frequent rests. In that rare atmosphere, after taking
seventy or eighty steps, our breath would be gone, our
muscles grew tired and strained, and we experienced all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the sensations of extreme fatigue. An instant's pause,
however, was sufficient to recover strength and breath,
and we would start again. The wind, which we had
not felt while climbing the steepest part of the mountain,
now again blew furiously, and we began to suffer
from the cold. Our course,&mdash;directed still diagonally
towards the left, thus shunning the severe exertion of
climbing straight up the dome, although at an ordinary
altitude the slope would be deemed easy,&mdash;brought
us first to the southwest peak. This is a long, exceedingly
sharp, narrow ridge, springing out from the main
dome for a mile into mid-air. The ridge affords not
over ten or twelve feet of foothold on top, and the
sides descend almost vertically. On the right side the
snow lay firm and smooth for a few feet on top, and
then descended in a steep, unbroken sheet, like an immense,
flowing curtain, into the tremendous basin
which lies on the west side of the mountain between
the southern and northern peaks, and which is inclosed
by them as by two mighty arms. The snow on the top
and left crest of the ridge was broken into high, sharp
pinnacles, with cracks and fissures extending to the
rocks a few feet below. The left side, too steep for the
snow to lie on, was vertical, bare rock. The wind blew
so violently that we were obliged to brace ourselves with
our Alpine staffs and use great caution to guard against
being swept off the ridge. We threw ourselves behind
the pinnacles or into the cracks every seventy steps,
for rest and shelter against the bitter, piercing wind.
Hastening forward in this way along the dizzy, narrow,
and precarious ridge, we reached at length the highest
point. Sheltered behind a pinnacle of ice we rested a
moment, took out our flags and fastened them upon
the Alpine staffs, and then, standing erect in the
furious blast, waved them in triumph with three cheers.
We stood a moment upon that narrow summit, bracing
ourselves against the tempest to view the prospect.
The whole country was shrouded in a dense sea of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
smoke, above which the mountain towered two thousand
feet in the clear, cloudless ether. A solitary peak
far to the southeast, doubtless Mount Adams, and one
or two others in the extreme northern horizon, alone
protruded above the pall. On every side of the mountain
were deep gorges falling off precipitously thousands
of feet, and from these the thunderous sound of avalanches
would rise occasionally. Far below were the
wide-extended glaciers already described. The wind
was now a perfect tempest, and bitterly cold; smoke
and mist were flying about the base of the mountain,
half hiding, half revealing its gigantic outlines; and
the whole scene was sublimely awful.</p>

<p>It was now five <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> We had spent eleven hours of
unremitted toil in making the ascent, and, thoroughly
fatigued, and chilled by the cold, bitter gale, we saw
ourselves obliged to pass the night on the summit without
shelter or food, except our meagre lunch. It would
have been impossible to descend the mountain before
nightfall, and sure destruction to attempt it in darkness.
We concluded to return to a mass of rocks not far below,
and there pass the night as best we could, burrowing
in the loose débris.</p>

<p>The middle peak of the mountain, however, was evidently
the highest, and we determined to first visit it.
Retracing our steps along the narrow crest of Peak
Success, as we named the scene of our triumph, we
crossed an intervening depression in the dome, and
ascended the middle peak, about a mile distant and
two hundred feet higher than Peak Success. Climbing
over a rocky ridge which crowns the summit, we found
ourselves within a circular crater two hundred yards
in diameter, filled with a solid bed of snow, and inclosed
with a rim of rocks projecting above the snow all around.
As we were crossing the crater on the snow, Van Trump
detected the odor of sulphur, and the next instant numerous
jets of steam and smoke were observed issuing
from the crevices of the rocks which formed the rim on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the northern side. Never was a discovery more welcome!
Hastening forward, we both exclaimed, as we
warmed our chilled and benumbed extremities over
one of Pluto's fires, that here we would pass the night,
secure against freezing to death, at least. These jets
were from the size of that of a large steampipe to a
faint, scarcely perceptible emission, and issued all
along the rim among the loose rocks on the northern
side for more than half the circumference of the crater.
At intervals they would puff up more strongly, and the
smoke would collect in a cloud until blown aside and
scattered by the wind, and then their force would abate
for a time.</p>

<p>A deep cavern, extending into and under the ice, and
formed by the action of heat, was found. Its roof was
a dome of brilliant green ice with long icicles pendent from
it, while its floor, composed of the rocks and débris
which formed the side of the crater, descended at an
angle of thirty degrees. Forty feet within its mouth
we built a wall of stones, inclosing a space five by six
feet around a strong jet of steam and heat. Unlike the
angular, broken rocks met with elsewhere, within the
crater we found well-rounded bowlders and stones of
all sizes worn as smooth by the trituration of the crater
as by the action of water. Nowhere, however, did we
observe any new lava or other evidences of recent volcanic
action excepting these issues of steam and smoke.
Inclosed within the rude shelter thus hastily constructed,
we discussed our future prospects while we
ate our lunch and warmed ourselves at our natural register.
The heat at the orifice was too great to bear for
more than an instant, but the steam wet us, the smell
of sulphur was nauseating, and the cold was so severe
that our clothes, saturated with the steam, froze stiff
when turned away from the heated jet. The wind
outside roared and whistled, but it did not much
affect us, secure within our cavern, except when an occasional
gust came down perpendicularly. However,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
we passed a most miserable night, freezing on one side,
and in a hot steam-sulphur-bath on the other.</p>

<p>The dawn at last slowly broke, cold and gray. The
tempest howled still wilder. As it grew light, dense
masses of driven mist went sweeping by overhead and
completely hid the sun, and enveloped the mountain so
as to conceal objects scarce a hundred feet distant.
We watched and waited with great anxiety, fearing
a storm which might detain us there for days without
food or shelter, or, worse yet, snow, which would render
the descent more perilous, or most likely impossible.
And when, at nine <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, an occasional rift in the driving
mist gave a glimpse of blue sky, we made haste to descend.
First, however, I deposited the brass plate
inscribed with our names in a cleft in a large bowlder
on the highest summit,&mdash;a huge mount of rocks on
the east side of our crater of refuge, which we named
Crater Peak,&mdash;placed the canteen alongside, and
covered it with a large stone. I was then literally
freezing in the cold, piercing blast, and was glad to
hurry back to the crater, breathless and benumbed.</p>

<p>We left our den of refuge at length, after exercising
violently to start the blood through our limbs, and, in
attempting to pass around the rocky summit, discovered
a second crater, larger than the first, perhaps three
hundred yards in diameter. It is circular, filled with a
bed of snow, with a rocky rim all around and numerous
jets of steam issuing from the rocks on the northern
side. Both craters are inclined&mdash;the first to the
west, and the latter to the east with a much steeper
inclination, about thirty degrees. The rim of the
second crater is higher, or the snow-field inside lower,
than that of the first, and upon the east side rises in a
rocky wall thirty feet above the snow within. From
the summit we obtained a view of the northern peak,
still partially enveloped in the driving mist. It appeared
about a mile distant, several hundred feet lower
than the center peak, and separated from it by a deeper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
more abrupt depression or gap than that separating
Crater and Success peaks. Like the latter, too, it is
a sharp, narrow ridge springing out from the main
mountain, and swept bare of snow on its summit by
the wind. The weather was still too threatening, the
glimpses of the sun and sky through the thick, flying
scud were too few and fugitive, to warrant us in visiting
this peak, which we named Peak Takhoma, to perpetuate
the Indian name of the mountain.</p>

<p>Our route back was the same as on the ascent. At
the steepest and most perilous point in descending the
steep gutter where we had been forced to cut steps in
the ice, we fastened one end of the rope as securely as
possible to a projecting rock, and lowered ourselves
down by it as far as it reached, thereby passing the
place with comparative safety. We were forced to
abandon the rope here, having no means of unfastening
it from the rock above. We reached the foot of the
rocky ledge or ridge, where the real difficulties and
dangers of the ascent commenced, at 1.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, four
and a half hours after leaving the crater. We had been
seven and a half hours in ascending from this point to
the summit of Peak Success, and in both cases we
toiled hard and lost no time.</p>

<p>We now struck out rapidly and joyfully for camp.
When nearly there Van Trump, in attempting to
descend a snowbank without his creepers, which he
had taken off for greater ease in walking, fell, shot like
lightning forty feet down the steep incline, and struck
among some loose rocks at its foot with such force as
to rebound several feet into the air; his face and hands
were badly skinned, and he received some severe
bruises and a deep, wide gash upon his thigh. Fortunately
the camp was not far distant, and thither
with great pain and very slowly he managed to hobble.
Once there I soon started a blazing fire, made coffee,
and roasted choice morsels of a marmot, Sluiskin having
killed and dressed four of these animals during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
our absence. Their flesh, like the badger's, is extremely
muscular and tough, and has a strong, disagreeable,
doggy odor.</p>

<p>Towards the close of our repast, we observed the
Indian approaching with his head down, and walking
slowly and wearily as though tired by a long tramp.
He raised his head as he came nearer, and, seeing us
for the first time, stopped short, gazed long and fixedly,
and then slowly drew near, eying us closely the while,
as if to see whether we were real flesh and blood or disembodied
ghosts fresh from the evil demon of Takhoma.
He seemed both astonished and delighted to
find us safe back, and kept repeating that we were
strong men and had brave hearts: "Skookum tilicum,
skookum tumtum." He expected never to see us
again, he said, and had resolved to start the next morning
for Olympia to report our destruction.</p>

<p>The weather was still raw and cold. A dense cloud
overhung and shrouded the triple crown of Takhoma
and made us rejoice at our timely descent. The
scanty shelter afforded by the few balsam firs about our
camp had been destroyed by the fire, and the situation
was terribly exposed to the chilly and piercing wind that
blew from the great ice-fields. Van Trump, however,
was too badly hurt to think of moving that night.
Heating some large stones we placed them at our feet,
and closely wrapped in our blankets slept soundly upon
the open ground, although we awoke in the morning
benumbed and chilled.</p>

<p>We found many fresh tracks and signs of the mountain-sheep
upon the snowfields, and hair and wool
rubbed off upon rocks, and places where they had lain
at night. The mountain-sheep of Takhoma is much
larger than the common goat, and is found only upon
the loftiest and most secluded peaks of the Cascade
Range. Even Sluiskin, a skillful hunter and accustomed
to the pursuit of this animal for years, failed to
kill one, notwithstanding he hunted assiduously during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
our entire stay upon the mountain, three days. Sluiskin
was greatly chagrined at his failure, and promised
to bring each of us a sheep-skin the following summer,
a promise which he faithfully fulfilled.</p>

<p>The glacial system of Takhoma is stupendous. The
mountain is really the focal centre and summit of a
region larger than Massachusetts, and the five large
rivers which water this region all find their sources in
its vast glaciers. They are the Cowlitz, which empties
into the Columbia; the White, Puyallup, and Nisqually
rivers, which empty into Puget Sound sixty,
forty, and twelve miles respectively north of Olympia;
and the Wenass, which flows eastward through the
range and empties into the Yakima, which joins the
Columbia four hundred miles above its mouth. These
are all large streams from seventy to a hundred miles
in length. The White, Puyallup, and Cowlitz rivers
are each navigable for steamboats for some thirty
miles, and like the Nisqually show their glacial origin
by their white and turgid water, which indeed gives the
former its name.</p>

<p>The southwestern sides of the mountain furnish the
glaciers which form the sources of the Nisqually, and
one of these, at Sluiskin's Falls, has been already described.
The main Nisqually glacier issues from the
deep abyss overhung by the vast rock along the face of
which our route of ascent lay, and extends in a narrow
and somewhat crooked canyon for two miles. The ice
at its extremity rises in an abrupt wall five hundred
feet high, and a noisy torrent pours out with great force
from beneath. This feature is characteristic of every
glacier. The main Cowlitz glacier issues from the southeast
side, just to the right of our ridge of ascent. Its
head fills a deep gorge at the foot of the eastern front
or face of the great mass of rock just referred to, and the
southern face of which overhangs the main Nisqually
glacier. Thus the heads of these glaciers are separated
only by this great rock, and are probably not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
more than half a mile apart, while their mouths are
three miles apart. Several smaller glaciers serve to
swell the waters of the Cowlitz. In like manner the
glaciers from the western side form the Puyallup, and
those from the northern and northwestern sides the
White River. The principal White River glacier is
nearly ten miles long, and its width is from two to four
miles. Its depth, or the thickness of its ice, must be
thousands of feet. Streams and rivulets under the
heat of the sun flow down its surface until swallowed
by the crevasses, and a lakelet of deep blue water an
eighth of a mile in diameter has been observed upon
the solid ice. Pouring down from the mountain, the
ice by its immense weight and force has gouged out a
mass upon the northeastern side a mile in thickness.
The geological formation of Takhoma poorly resists the
eroding power of these mighty glaciers, for it seems to
be composed not of solid rock, but of a basaltic conglomerate
in strata, as though the volcanic force had
burst through and rent in pieces some earlier basaltic
outflow, and had heaped up this vast pile from the
fragments in successive strata. On every side the
mountain is slowly disintegrating.</p>

<p>What other peak can offer to scientific examination
or to the admiration of tourists fourteen living glaciers
of such magnitude, issuing from every side, or such
grandeur, beauty, and variety of scenery?</p>

<p>At daylight we broke up our camp at Sluiskin's Falls,
and moved slowly, on account of Van Trump's hurt,
down the ridge about five miles to Clear Creek, where
we again regaled ourselves upon a hearty repast of marmots,
or "raw dog," as Van Trump styled them in
derision both of the viand and of the cookery. I was
convinced from the lay of the country that Clear Creek
flowed into the Nisqually, or was, perhaps, the main
stream itself, and that the most direct and feasible route
back to Bear Prairie would be found by following down
the valley of these streams to the trail leading from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the Nisqually to Bear Prairie. Besides, it was evidently
impossible for Van Trump, in his bruised and injured
state, to retrace our rough route over the mountains.
Leaving him as comfortable as possible, with all our
scanty stock of flour and marmots, sufficient to last
him nearly a week in case of need, I started immediately
after dinner, with Sluiskin leading the way,
to explore this new route. The Indian had opposed
the attempt strenuously, insisting with much urgency
that the stream flowed through canyons impossible for
us to traverse. He now gradually veered away from
the course of the stream, until ere-long he was leading
directly up the steep mountain range upon our former
route, when I called him back peremptorily, and kept
him in the rear for a little distance. Traveling through
open timber, over ground rapidly descending, we came
at the end of two miles to where the stream is hemmed
in between one of the long ridges or spurs from Takhoma
and the high mountain-chain on the south.
The stream, receiving many affluents on both sides, its
clear waters soon discolored by the yeasty glacial torrents,
here loses its peaceful flow, and for upwards of
three miles rushes furiously down a narrow, broken, and
rocky bed in a succession of falls and cascades of great
picturesque beauty. With much toil and difficulty
we picked our way over a wide "talus" of huge, broken
granite blocks and bowlders, along the foot of a vast
mountain of solid granite on the south side of the river,
until near the end of the defile, then crossed the stream,
and soon after encountered a still larger branch coming
from the north, direct from Takhoma, the product,
doubtless, of the glaciers on the southern and southwestern
sides. Fording this branch just above its confluence
with the other, we followed the general course
of the river, now unmistakably the Nisqually, for
about four miles; then, leaving it, we struck off nearly
south through the forest for three miles, and emerged
upon the Bear Prairie. The distance was about thirteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
miles from where we left Van Trump, and we were
only some six hours in traveling it, while it took seventeen
hours of terribly severe work to make the mountain-route
under Sluiskin's guidance.</p>

<p>Without his help on the shorter route, too, it would
have taken me more than twice the time it did. For
the manner in which, after entering the defile of the
Nisqually, Sluiskin again took the lead and proceeded
in a direct and unhesitating course, securing every
advantage of the ground, availing himself of the wide,
rocky bars along the river, crossing and recrossing the
milky flood which rushed along with terrific swiftness
and fury, and occasionally forcing his way through the
thick timber and underbrush in order to cut off wide
bends of the river, and at length leaving it and striking
boldly through the forest to Bear Prairie, proved him
familiar with every foot of the country. His objections
to the route evidently arose from the jealousy so common
with his people of further exploration of the
country by the whites. As long as they keep within
the limits already known and explored, they are faithful
and indefatigable guides, but they invariably interpose
every obstacle their ingenuity can suggest to deter
the adventurous mountaineer from exposing the few
last hidden recesses that remain unexplored.</p>

<p>Mr. Coleman was found safe in camp, and seemed too
glad to see us to think of reproaching us for our summary
abandonment. He said that in attempting to
follow us he climbed up so precipitous a place that,
encumbered with his heavy pack, he could neither
advance nor recede. He was compelled, therefore, to
throw off the pack, which rolled to the very bottom of
the mountain, and being thus delivered of his necessary
outfit, he was forced to return to camp. He had been
unable to find his pack, but having come across some
cricketer's spikes among his remaining effects, he was
resolved to continue his trip to, and make the ascent
of, Rainier by himself; he had just completed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
preparations, and especially had deposited on top of
the lofty mountain which overlooked the prairie two
caches, or stores, of provisions.</p>

<p>At daylight next morning, Sluiskin, with his little boy
riding one of his own ponies, himself riding our little
calico-colored pack-horse, now well rested and saucy,
started back for Van Trump, with directions to meet
us at the trail on the Nisqually. A heavy, drizzling
rain set in soon afterwards; Mr. Coleman, who had
gone early to bring in the contents of his mountain-top
caches, returned about noon with a very small bundle,
and, packing our traps upon Sluiskin's other pony, we
moved over to the rendezvous, pitched Coleman's
large gum-sheet as a partial shelter, made a rousing
fire, and tried to be comfortable. Late in the afternoon
the pony set up a violent neighing, and in a few
minutes Van Trump, and Sluiskin with his little boy
behind him, rode up, drenched to the skin. By following
the bed of the river, frequently crossing and recrossing,
the Indian had managed to ride to the very foot of
the Nisqually defile, when, leaving the horses in this
boy's care, he hastened to Van Trump and carefully led
and assisted him down. Despite the pain of his severe
hurts, the latter was much amused at Sluiskin's account
of our trip, and of finding Mr. Coleman safe in camp
making tea, and for long after would repeat as an excellent
joke Sluiskin's remark on passing the point
where he had attempted to mislead me, "Skookum
tenas man hiyu goddam."</p>

<p>We sent the horses back by the Indian to Bear
Prairie for grass, there being no indications of the rain
ceasing. The storm indeed lasted three days, during
which we remained sheltered beneath the gum-sheet as
far as possible, and endeavored to counteract the rain
by heaping up our fire in front. About eight o'clock
on the second morning, Sluiskin reported himself with
our horse, which he returned, he said, because he was
about to return to his lodge on the Cowlitz, being destitute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of shelter and food for his family on Bear Prairie.
He vigorously replenished the fire, declined breakfast,
jeered Coleman for turning back, although probably
the latter did not comprehend his broken lingo, and
departed.</p>

<p>Sluiskin was an original and striking character.
Leading a solitary life of hardships amidst these wilds,
yet of unusual native intelligence, he had contrived,
during rare visits to the settlements, to acquire the
Chinook jargon, besides a considerable stock of English
words, while his fund of general information was really
wonderful. He was possessed of a shrewd, sarcastic
wit, and, making no pretense to the traditional gravity
of his race, did not scruple to use it freely. Yet beneath
this he cherished a high sense of pride and personal
independence. Although of the blood of the
numerous and powerful Yakimas, who occupied the
country just east of the Cascades, he disdained to render
allegiance to them or any tribe, and undoubtedly
regarded the superintendent of Indian affairs, or even
the great father at Washington himself, with equally
contemptuous indifference.</p>

<p>As the last rays of the sun, one warm, drowsy summer
afternoon, were falling aslant the shady streets of Olympia,
Mr. Longmire's well-worn family carry-all, drawn
by two fat, grass-fed horses, came rattling down the
main street at a most unusual pace for them; two bright
flags attached to Alpine staffs, one projecting from each
door, fluttered gayly overhead, while the occupants
of the carriage looked eagerly forth to catch the first
glimpse of welcoming friends. We returned after our
tramp of two hundred and forty miles with visages
tanned and sun-scorched, and with forms as lean and
gaunt as greyhounds, and were received and lionized
to the full, like veterans returning from an arduous and
glorious campaign. For days afterward, in walking
along the smooth and level pavements, we felt a strong
impulse to step high, as though still striding over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
innumerable fallen logs and boughs of the forest, and
for weeks our appetites were a source of astonishment
to our friends and somewhat mortifying to ourselves.
More than two months had elapsed before Mr. Van
Trump fully recovered from his hurts. We published
at the time short newspaper accounts of the ascent,
and, although an occasional old Puget Sounder will
still growl, "They say they went on top of Mount
Rainier, but I'd like to see them prove it," we were
justly regarded as the first, and as I believe the only
ones up to the present time, who have ever achieved
the summit of Takhoma.</p>

National Park. The name was bestowed upon them by Stevens

he delivered an eloquent plea in the Chinook jargon accompanied

<p class="hang">The speech was remembered and repeated by the white men when
they returned among their friends. One of those who committed
it to memory was former Congressman M. C. George

<span class="smcap">Translation by General Stevens</span><br />
</p>

<p>Listen to me, my good friends. I must talk to you.</p>

<p>Your plan to climb Takhoma is all foolishness. No
one can do it and live. A mighty chief dwells upon
the summit in a lake of fire. He brooks no intruders.</p>

<p>Many years ago my grandfather, the greatest and
bravest chief of all the Yakima, climbed nearly to the
summit. There he caught sight of the fiery lake and
the infernal demon coming to destroy him, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
fled down the mountain, glad to escape with his life.
Where he failed, no other Indian ever dared make the
attempt.</p>

<p>At first the way is easy, the task seems light. The
broad snowfields, over which I have often hunted the
mountain goat, offer an inviting path. But above
them you will have to climb over steep rocks overhanging
deep gorges where a misstep would hurl you
far down&mdash;down to certain death. You must creep
over steep snow banks and cross deep crevasses where
a mountain goat could hardly keep his footing. You
must climb along steep cliffs where rocks are continually
falling to crush you, or knock you off into the
bottomless depths.</p>

<p>And if you should escape these perils and reach
the great snowy dome, then a bitterly cold and furious
tempest will sweep you off into space like a withered
leaf. But if by some miracle you should survive all
these perils the mighty demon of Takhoma will surely
kill you and throw you into the fiery lake.</p>

<p>Don't you go!</p>

<p>You make my heart sick when you talk of climbing
Takhoma. You will perish if you try to climb Takhoma.
You will perish and your people will blame
me.</p>

<p>Don't go!</p>

<p>Don't go!</p>

<p>If you will go, I will wait here two days, and then
go to Olympia and tell your people that you perished
on Takhoma. Give me a paper to them to let them
know that I am not to blame for your death.</p>

<p>My talk is ended.</p>

VIII. SECOND SUCCESSFUL ASCENT, 1870<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> S. F. EMMONS</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang">Later in the same year, 1870, when Stevens and Van Trump made
their first successful ascent, the achievement was also accomplished
by S. F. Emmons and A. D. Wilson of the Geological
Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel. Samuel Franklin
Emmons was born at Boston on March 29, 1841. He died
painlessly and unexpectedly on the eve of his seventieth birthday,
March 28, 1911.</p>

<p class="hang">George F. Becker gave him a fervent eulogy which appeared in the
Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers
for 1911. He says: "There is not a geological society or even
a mining camp from Arctic Finland to the Transvaal, or from
Alaska to Australia, where Emmons's name is not honored and
his authority recognized." With all his fame and ability, the
biographer declares, he was modest to diffidence.</p>

<p class="hang">His account of the ascent is in the form of a letter to his chief,
Clarence King, who published it in the American Journal of
Science for March, 1871. It is here reproduced from that
source. The photograph of Mr. Emmons was obtained from
the United States Geological Survey. It will be noticed that
Mr. Emmons calls the mountain Tachoma.</p>

<p class="hang">The Mountain's largest glacier, to which he refers with enthusiasm,
was for a long time known by the name of White River which it
feeds. It is peculiarly appropriate that that glacier should
bear the name given it on the official map of the United States
Geological Survey&mdash;Emmons Glacier.</p></blockquote>

<p>The glaciers of Mt. Tachoma, or Rainier as it is
more commonly called, form the principal sources of
four important rivers of Washington Territory, viz:
the Cowlitz, which flows into the Columbia, and the
Nisqually, Puyallup and White rivers which empty
into Puget Sound. In accordance with your instructions,
Mr. A. D. Wilson and I visited this mountain
in the early part of October, 1870, and carried the work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of making its complete survey, both geological and
topographical, as far as the lateness of the season and
the means at our disposal would permit. As the topographical
work has not yet been plotted, the figures
given in my notes are merely estimates, and liable to
subsequent correction. I herewith transmit an abstract
from my notes upon the glaciers, embracing
those of rather more than half the slopes of the mountain,
those on the eastern side, from the extreme
southern to the extreme northern point.</p>

<p>The summit of Tachoma is formed by three peaks,
a southern, an eastern, and a northwestern: of these
the eastern is the highest; those on the south and
northwest, being apparently a few hundred feet lower,
are distant about a mile and a half to two miles from
this, and separated by deep valleys. The eastern
peak, which would seem to have formed originally the
middle of the mountain mass, is a crater about a quarter
of a mile in diameter of very perfect circular form.
Its sides are bare for about 60 feet from the rim, below
which they are covered by a <i>névé</i> having a slope of
from 28° to 31°. This <i>névé</i> extending from the shoulders
of the southwestern peak to those of the northern,
a width of several miles, descends to a vertical distance
of about 2000 feet below the crater rim, an immense
sheet of white granular ice, having the general form of
the mountain surface, and broken only by long transverse
crevasses, one of those observed being from one
to two miles in length: it is then divided up by the
several jutting rock-masses or shoulder of the mountain
into the Nisqually, Cowlitz and White River glaciers,
falling in distinct ice cascades for about 3000 feet at
very steep angles, which sometimes approach the perpendicular.
From the foot of these cascades flow the
glaciers proper, at a more gentle angle, growing narrower
and sinking deeper into the mountain as they
descend. From the intervening spurs, which slope
even more gradually, they receive many tributary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
glaciers, while some of these secondary glaciers form
independent streams, which only join the main river
many miles below the end of the glaciers.</p>

<p>The Nisqually, the narrowest of the three main
glaciers above mentioned, has the most sinuous course,
varying in direction from southwest to south, while
its lower extremity is somewhat west of south of the
main peak: it receives most of its tributaries from the
spur to the east, and has a comparatively regular
slope in its whole length below the cascades. There
are some indications of dirt-bands on its surface, when
seen from a considerable elevation. Toward its lower
end it is very much broken up by transverse and longitudinal
crevasses: this is due to the fact, that it has
here cut through the more yielding strata of volcanic
rock, and come upon an underlying and unconformable
mass of syenite. The ice front at its base is about
500 feet in height, and the walls of lava which bound its
sides rise from 1000 to 1500 feet above the surface of
the ice, generally in sheer precipices.</p>

<p>The bed of the Cowlitz glacier is generally parallel
to that of the Nisqually, though its curves are less
marked: the ice cascades in which each originates,
fall on either side of a black cliff of bedded lava and
breccia scarcely a thousand feet in horizontal thickness,
while the mouths of the glaciers, if I may be
allowed the expression, are about three miles apart.
From the jutting edge of this cliff hang enormous
icicles from 75 to 100 feet in length. The slope of
this glacier is less regular, being broken by subordinate
ice cascades. Like the Nisqually its lower extremity
stretches out as it were into the forest, the slopes on
either side, where not too steep, being covered with
the mountain fir (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picea nobilis</i>) for several hundred feet
above the level of the ice, while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinus flexilis</i> grows
at least 2000 feet higher than the mouth of the glacier.</p>

<p>The general course of this glacier is south, but at its
extremity it bends to the eastward, apparently deflected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
from its course by a cliff of older felsitic rock,
more resisting than the lava. The consequence of
this deflection is a predominance of longitudinal over
transverse crevasses at this point, and an unusually
large moraine at its western side, which rises several
hundred feet above the surface of the glaciers, and
partakes of the character of both lateral and terminal
moraines: the main medial moraine of the glacier
joins this near its lower end. This medial moraine
proceeds from the cliff which bounds the ice cascade
source of the glacier on the north, and brings down a
dark porous lava which is only found high up on the
mountain near the crater. The position of the medial
moraine on the glacier would indicate that at least
half its mass came from the spur on the east, which is
probably the case.</p>

<p>This spur, comprehending the whole mass between
the Cowlitz and White Rivers glaciers, has the shape
of a triangle whose apex is formed by a huge pinnacle
of rock, which, as its bedding indicates, once formed
part of the crust of the mountain, but now stands
isolated, a jagged peak rising about 3000 feet above
the glaciers at its foot, so steep that neither ice nor
snow rest upon it. One of the tributaries to the Cowlitz
glacier from this spur brings down with it a second
medial moraine, which is traceable to the mouth of the
glacier, though in general these tributary glaciers bring
no medial moraines.</p>

<p>On the eastern slopes of this spur between the two
above named glaciers, spread secondary glaciers, frequently
of great width, but owing to the limited height
of their initial points, of inconsiderable length. These
end generally in perpendicular cliffs overhanging the
rocky amphitheaters at the heads of the smaller
streams which flow eastward into the Cowlitz. Looking
up from the bottom of one of these amphitheaters
one sees a semi-circular wall of nearly 2000 feet of
sheer rock, surmounted by about 500 feet of ice, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
under which small streams of water issue, falling in
silvery cascades on to the green bottom below.</p>

<p>A ridge of high jagged peaks connects this spur with
the main range of the Cascade Mts. in the east, and
forms the water-shed between the White and Cowlitz
rivers. From the connecting saddle one can look
northward across the brink of six glaciers, which all
contribute to the White River; of these the first four
come from the triangular spur already mentioned and
are of comparatively little extent. The first two are,
however, interesting from the vein structure which
they exhibit; they both originate in an irregularly oblong
basin, having the shape somewhat of an inclined
ellipse, turning on its longer diameter, the outlets of
the glacier being opposite the foci. Seen from a high
point the veins form concentric lines generally parallel
to the sides of the basin; the ends of those towards
the center gradually bend round, until they join
together in the form of a figure 8, and finally just above
the outlets form two small ellipses. They thus constantly
preserve a direction at right angles to that of
the pressure exerted, downward by the movement of
the ice mass, and upward by the resistance to this
movement of the rock mass between the two outlets.</p>

<p>The main White River glacier, the grandest of the
whole,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
pours straight down from the rim of the crater
in a northeasterly direction, and pushes its extremity
farther out into the valley than any of the others. Its
greatest width on the steep slope of the mountain must
be four or five miles, narrowing towards its extremity
to about a mile and a half; its length can be scarcely
less than ten miles. The great eroding power of glacial
ice is strikingly illustrated in this glacier, which seems
to have cut down and carried away on the northeastern
side of the mountain, fully a third of its mass. The
thickness of rock cut away as shown by the walls on
either side, and the isolated peak at the head of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
triangular spur, in which the bedding of the successive
flows of lava, forming the original mountain crust, is
very regular and conformable, may be roughly estimated
at somewhat over a mile. Of the thickness of
the ice of the glacier I have no data for making estimates,
though it may probably be reckoned in thousands
of feet.</p>

<p>It has two principal medial moraines, which, where
crossed by us, formed little mountain ridges having
peaks nearly 100 feet high. The sources of these
moraines are cliffs on the steeper mountain slope,
which seem mere black specks in the great white field
above: between these are great cascades, and below
immense transverse crevasses, which we had no time
or means to visit. The surface water flows in rills
and brooks, on the lower portion of the glacier, and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moulins</i> are of frequent occurrence. We visited one
double <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moulin</i> where two brooks poured into two circular
wells, each about ten feet in diameter, joined
together at the surface but separated below: we could
not approach near enough the edge to see the bottom of
either, but, as stones thrown in sent back no sound,
judged they must be very deep.</p>

<p>This glacier forks near the foot of the steeper mountain
slope, and sends off a branch to the northward,
which forms a large stream flowing down to join the
main stream fifteen or twenty miles below. Looking
down on this from a high overhanging peak, we could
see, as it were, under our feet, a little lake of deep blue
water, about an eighth of a mile in diameter, standing
in the brown gravel-covered ice of the end of the
glacier. On the back of the rocky spur, which divides
these two glaciers, a secondary glacier has scooped out
a basin-shaped bed, and sends down an ice stream,
having all the characteristics of a true glacier, but its
ice disappears several miles above the mouths of the
large glaciers on either side. Were nothing known of
the movement of glaciers, an instance like this would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
seem to afford sufficient evidence that such movement
exists, and that gravity is the main motive power.
From our northern and southern points we could trace
the beds of several large glaciers to the west of us,
whose upper and lower portions only were visible, the
main body of the ice lying hidden by the high intervening
spurs.</p>

<p>Ten large glaciers observed by us, and at least half
as many more hidden by the mountain from our view,
proceeding thus from an isolated peak, form a most
remarkable system, and one worthy of a careful and
detailed study.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> BAILEY WILLIS</small></h2>

<blockquote><p class="hang">The Northwest for April, 1883, which was Number 2 of Volume I
of that magazine, contained an article by Bailey Willis, Assistant
Geologist of the Northern Transcontinental Survey. The
article is entitled "Canyons and Glaciers. A Journey to the
Ice Fields of Mount Tacoma." Mr. Willis was born at Idlewild-on-Hudson,
New York, on May 31, 1857. It speaks well
for his skill and training that he should have attained to such
a position at twenty-four years of age.</p>

<p class="hang">Since then he has worked out a great career in the United States
Geological Survey, in China and in other parts of the world.
He is now Professor of Geology at Stanford University. He
has kindly revised for this publication the product of his
younger years. And there has also been found a photograph
of the geologist as he appeared when the surveys were made.</p>

<p class="hang">To this day, people who visit the northern slopes and parks of
the mountain become familiar with the Bailey Willis trail and
from Moraine Park they get a view of the wonderful Willis
Wall named in his honor.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Puyallup River, which empties into Puget Sound
near New Tacoma, heads in three glaciers on Mount
Tacoma. During the summer months, when the ice
and snow on the mountains are thawing, the water is
discolored with mud from the glaciers and carries a
large amount of sediment out to Commencement Bay.
If the Coast Survey charts are correct, soundings near
the centre of the bay have changed from one hundred
fathoms and "no bottom" in 1867, to eighty
fathoms and "gray mud" in 1877. But when the
nights in the hills begin to be frosty, the stream becomes
clearer, and in winter the greater volume of
spring water gives it a deep green tint.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>For twenty miles from the Sound the valley is nearly
level. The bluffs along the river are of coarse gravel,
the soil is alluvium, and a well sunk a hundred feet
at the little town of Puyallup passed through gravel
and sand to tide mud and brackish water. From the
foot-hills to its mouth the river meanders over an old
valley of unknown depth, now filled with material
brought down by its several branches. About eighteen
miles above its mouth the river forks, and the northern
portion takes the name of Carbon River; the southern
was formerly called the South Fork, but it should retain
the name of Puyallup to its next division far up in
the mountains. A short distance above their junction
both Carbon River and the Puyallup escape from narrow,
crooked cañons, whose vertical sides, one hundred
to three hundred feet high, are often but fifty feet
apart. From these walls steep, heavily timbered slopes
rise two hundred to eight hundred feet to the summits
of the foot-hills. These cañons link the buried river
basin of the lower stream with the upper river valleys.
The latter extend from the heads of the cañons to the
glaciers. They are apparently the deserted beds of
mightier ice rivers, now shrunk to the very foot of
Mount Tacoma.</p>

<p>From New Tacoma the entire course of the Puyallup
and part of Carbon River are in view. Across Commencement
Bay are the tide marshes of the delta;
back from these salt meadows the light green of the
cottonwoods, alder and vine-maple mark the river's
course, till it is lost in the dark monotone of the fir
forest. No break in the evergreen surface indicates
the place of the river cañons; but far out among the
foot-hills a line of mist hangs over the upper valley of
Carbon River, which winds away eastward, behind
the rising ground, to the northern side of Mount Tacoma.
Milk Creek, one of its branches, drains the
northwest spur, and on the western slope the snows
accumulate in two glaciers, from which flow the North
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and South Forks of the Puyallup. These streams
meet in a level valley at the base of three singular
peaks, and plunge united into the dark gateway of the
cañon.</p>

<p>A trip to the grand snow peak from which these
rivers spring was within a year a very difficult undertaking.
There was no trail through the dense forest,
no supply depot on the route. No horse nor donkey
could accompany the explorer, who took his blankets
and provisions on his back, and worked his way slowly
among the towering tree trunks, through underbrush
luxuriant as a tropic jungle. But last summer a good
horse trail was built from Wilkeson to Carbon River,
crossing it above the cañon, sixteen miles below the
glacier, and during the autumn it was extended to the
head of the Puyallup. Wilkeson is reached by a branch
railroad from New Tacoma. It is on a small tributary
of Carbon River, called Fletts Creek, at a point where
the brook runs from a narrow gorge into a valley about
a quarter of a mile wide. Coal mines are opened at this
point. The horse trail climbs at once from Wilkeson
to the first terrace, four hundred feet above the valley;
then winds a quarter of a mile back through the forest
to the second ascent of a hundred feet, and then a mile
over the level to the third. Hidden here beneath the
thick covering of moss and undergrowth of the primeval
forest, fourteen hundred feet above the present
ocean level, are ancient shore lines of the sea, which
has left its trace in similar terraces in all the valleys
about the Sound.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Thence the trail extends southward
over a level plateau. Carbon River Cañon is
but half a mile away on the west, and five miles from
Wilkeson the valley above the cañon is reached. The
descent to the river is over three miles along the hillside
eastward.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>
<p>From Wilkeson to the river the way is all through
a belt of forest, where the conditions of growth are very
favorable. The fir trees are massive, straight and free
from limbs to a great height. The larger ones, eight
to twelve feet in diameter on a level with a man's
head, carry their size upward, tapering very gradually,
till near the top they shoot out a thick mat of
foliage and the trunk in a few feet diminishes to a
point. One such was measured; it stands like a huge
obelisk 180 feet, without a limb, supporting a crown of
but forty feet more. The more slender trees are,
curiously enough, the taller; straight, clear shafts
rise 100 to 150 feet, topped with foliage whose highest
needles would look down on Trinity spire. Cedars,
hemlocks, spruce and white fir mingle with these giants,
but they do not compete with them in height; they fill
in the spaces in the vast colonnades. Below is the carpet
of deep golden green moss and glossy ferns, and the
tangle of vines and bushes that cover the fallen trunks
of the fathers of the forest.</p>

<p>The silence of these mountains is awesome, the solitude
oppressive. The deer, the bear, the panther are
seldom met; they see and hear first and silently slip
away, leaving only their tracks to prove their numbers.
There are very few birds. Blue jays, and their
less showy gray, but equally impudent, cousins, the
"whiskey jacks," assemble about a camp; but in passing
through the forest one may wander a whole day
and see no living thing save a squirrel, whose shrill
chatter is startling amid the silence. The wind plays in
the tree tops far overhead, but seldom stirs the branches
of the smaller growth. The great tree trunks stand
immovable. The more awful is it when a gale roars
through the timber; when the huge columns sway in
unison and groan with voices strangely human. It is
fearful to lie in the utter darkness of a stormy night,
listening to the pulsating rush of the wind, the moan
of the forest and the crash of uprooted giants upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the ground&mdash;listening with bated breath for the report
which may foretell the fall of yonder tall decaying
shaft, whose thick, deep cleft bark blazed so brightly
on the now dying camp fire. The effect of one such
storm is seen in Carbon River Valley, above and below
where the trail crosses. The blast followed the
stream and the mountain slope on the south side; over
an area eight miles long and a half a mile to a mile
wide the forest is prostrate. Single trees stand gaunt
and charred by a recent fire, but their comrades are
piled like jackstraws, the toys of the tornado. Over
and under each other they lie, bent and interlaced,
twenty, thirty feet deep. Pigmy man strained his
eyes to see their tops, when they stood erect; now he
vainly stands on tiptoe to look over them in their fallen
majesty.</p>

<p>To the head of Carbon River from the bridge, on
which the trail crosses it, is about sixteen miles. The
rocky bed of the river is 100 to 200 yards wide, a gray
strip of polished boulders between sombre mountain
slopes, that rise sharply from it. The stream winds in
ever-shifting channels among the stones. About six
miles above the bridge Milk Creek dashes down from
its narrow gorge into the river. The high pinnacles
of the spur from which it springs are hidden by the
nearer fir-clad ridges. Between their outlines shines
the northern peak of Mount Tacoma, framed in dark
evergreen spires. Its snow fields are only three miles
distant, but Carbon River has come a long way round.
For six miles eastward the undulating lines of the
mountains converge, then those on the north suddenly
cross the view, where the river cañon turns sharply
southward.</p>

<p>Three miles from this turn is Crescent Mountain, its
summit a semi-circular gray wall a thousand feet high.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
At sunset the light from the west streams across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
head of Milk Creek and Carbon River, illuminating
these cliffs as with the glow of volcanic fires, while
twilight deepens in the valley. The next turn of the
river brings Mount Tacoma again in view. Close on
the right a huge buttress towers up, cliff upon cliff,
2,500 feet, a single one of the many imposing rock
masses that form the Ragged Spur between Carbon
River and Milk Creek. The more rapid fall of the river,
the increasing size of the boulders, show the nearness of
the glacier. Turning eastward to the south of Crescent
Mountain, you pass the group of trees that hide it.</p>

<p>This first sight is a disappointment. The glacier is
a very dirty one. The face is about 300 feet long and
thirty to forty feet high. It entirely fills the space between
two low cliffs of polished gray rock. Throughout
the mass the snows of successive winters are interstratified
with the summers' accumulations of earth
and rock. From a dark cavern, whose depths have
none of the intense blue color so beautiful in crevasses
in clear ice, Carbon River pours out, a muddy torrent.
The top of the glacier is covered with earth about six
inches deep, contributed to its mass by the cliffs on
either side and by an island of rock, where a few pines
grow, entirely surrounded by the ice river. The eye
willingly passes over this dirty mass to the gleaming
northeast spur of the mountain, where the sunlight
lingers after the chill night wind has begun to blow from
the ice fields.</p>

<p>The disappointment of this view of the glacier leaves
one unprepared for the beauty of that from Crescent
Mountain. The ascent from a point a short distance
down the river is steep, but not dangerous. The lower
slopes are heavily timbered, but at an elevation of 4,000
feet juniper and dwarf pine are dotted over the grassy
hillside. Elk, deer and white mountain goats find here
a pleasant pasture; their trails look like well trodden
sheep paths on a New England hill. A curious badger-like
animal, sitting erect on his hind legs, greets one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
with a long shrill whistle that would make a schoolboy
envious, but trots quickly away on nearer approach.
The crest of the southwest rim of the amphitheater
is easily gained, and the grandeur of the view bursts
upon you suddenly. Eastward are the cliffs and cañons
of the Cascade Range. Northward forest-covered hill
and valley reach to Mount Baker and the snow peaks
that break the horizon line. Westward are the blue
waters of the Sound, the snow-clad Olympics and a
faint soft line beyond; it may be the ocean or a fog
bank above it. Southward, 9,000 feet above you, so
near you must throw your head back to see its summit,
is grand Mount Tacoma; its graceful northern
peak piercing the sky, it soars single and alone.
Whether touched by the glow of early morning or
gleaming in bright noonday, whether rosy with sunset
light or glimmering ghost-like, in the full moon, whether
standing out clear and cloudless or veiled among the
mists it weaves from the warm south winds, it is always
majestic and inspiring, always attractive and
lovely. It is the symbol of an awful power clad in
beauty.</p>

<p>This northern slope of the mountain is very steep,
and the consolidated snow begins its downward movement
from near the top. Little pinnacles of rock project
through the mass and form eddies in the current.
A jagged ridge divides it, and part descends into the
deep unexplored cañon of White River, probably the
deepest chasm in the flanks of Mount Tacoma. The
other part comes straight on toward the southern side
of Crescent Mountain, a precipice 2,000 feet high;
diverted, it turns in graceful flowing curves, breaks
into a thousand ice pyramids and descends into the
narrow pass, where its beauty is hidden under the
ever-falling showers of rock.</p>

<p>This rim you stand upon is very narrow; a hundred
feet wide, sometimes less, between the cliff that rises
2,000 feet above the glacier and the descent of a thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
feet on the other side. Snow lies upon part of
this slope; stones, started from the edge, leap in
lengthening bounds over its firm surface and plunge
with a splash into the throat of the lakelet that lies
in the amphitheater. The ice slope, dipping into the
clear water, passes from purest white to deepest blue as
it passes out of sight in the depths of the basin.</p>

<p>A two days' visit to this trackless region sufficed
only to see a small part of the magnificent scenery.
White River Cañon, the cliffs of Ragged Spur, the
northern slope of Mount Tacoma, where the climber
is always tempted upward, might occupy him for
weeks. Across the snow fields, where Milk Creek
rises, is the glacier of the North Fork of the Puyallup,
and the end of the horse trail we left at Carbon River
is within six miles of its base. When a trail is built
up Carbon River, the way across this divide will be
found, and, with comfortable stopping places on the
two rivers, the tourist can pass a delightful week amid
scenery we now cross the ocean to Switzerland to see.</p>

X. DISCOVERY OF CAMP MUIR, 1888<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> MAJOR E. S. INGRAHAM</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang">Major Edward Sturgis Ingraham has visited the mountain
annually since 1888. He has ascended to the summit seven
times and has spent as many nights in the crater. It was he
who gave to a number of the prominent features of the Park
their beautiful and enduring names.</p>

<p class="hang">On his first ascent in 1888 the party included John Muir, most
famous naturalist of the Pacific Slope. Since he found a
sheltered pumice patch and suggested camping there for the
night, Major Ingraham called it Camp Muir, now well known
to all climbers.</p>

<p class="hang">Major Ingraham prepared an account of the ascent which was published
in The Puget Sound Magazine for October, 1888. That
magazine has long since ceased to be issued. It was edited
by the editor of this present work, who has rescued the article
from the rare and almost forgotten files.</p>

<p class="hang">After an extensive career as superintendent of schools, printer,
militia officer and miner, Major Ingraham has been devoting
his later years to the boy scout work, in which his love for the
mountains plays an important part.</p>

<p class="hang">A glacier on the mountain bears the name of Ingraham. How that
came to be, is related by him as follows: "One time when I was
on the mountain encamped at the Camp of the Clouds, Professor
I. C. Russell and another man, both in their shirt sleeves,
came tottering into my camp at early morning. They had
been caught upon the summit and had spent a shivering night
in the crater. I treated them the best I knew how and they
departed. When their maps came out I found that a beautiful
glacier had been named for me&mdash;Ingraham Glacier."</p></blockquote>


<p>Mount Rainier, one of Nature's masterpieces, is the
most striking object of grandeur and beauty amidst
the unsurpassed scenery of Washington Territory.
Occupying nearly a central position geographically
in the Territory, it is alike an object of pride to the
inhabitants of the Great Plain of the Columbia and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to the dwellers on Puget Sound. There are other
peaks that command our attention, but it is to the
old monarch that we turn with unfeigned pride and
exclaim, "Behold a masterpiece!"</p>

<p>The height of Mount Rainier, as estimated by triangulation,
is 14,444 feet. This height was verified
by barometer in the hands of one party that reached
the summit in the month of August of the present year.
From many points of view it appears a single peak;
but in reality it is composed of three peaks of nearly
the same height. These peaks may be designated as
northern, crater and southern. They are not in direct
line, but occupy apexes of an obtuse-angled triangle.
The northern peak is a cone, with its apex about two
miles from the summit of crater peak; the southern
peak is somewhat flattened on top, and is about one
and one-half miles from crater peak. Crater peak,
as the name suggests, has two large craters, with well-defined
rims&mdash;one sloping slightly towards the northeast,
and the other towards the southwest. The culminating
point of this peak is a sugarloaf-shape mass
of pure snow, about one hundred feet above all adjacent
points. The northern and southern peaks are
inaccessible, except from crater peak, owing to the
precipitous condition of their sides, which are so steep
that snow will not cling to them except in small
patches. Down these sides, during some seasons of
the year, avalanches go thundering almost hourly with
a roar that makes the tourist shudder with fear.</p>

<p>The volcanic condition of Mount Rainier is everywhere
apparent. For miles before the base is reached
vast quantities of ashes, forming the greater part of
the soil of that region, plainly tell of extensive eruptions;
the immediate foothills are covered with masses
of red and black lava; while pumice is found in great
abundance upon some of the ridges. All these evidences
suggest that, long ages ago, Rainier was the
scene of volcanic activity of immense magnitude.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Ascend to the top, behold the two well-defined craters,
with their rims perfect; descend those walls, and try
to count the many jets of steam constantly puffing
forth their sulphurous odors, and one is led to believe
that Rainier has been active at a comparatively recent
period.</p>

<p>Mount Rainier, with its many glaciers, is the source
of the principal rivers of Western Washington. From
the summit of the three peaks the snow forges its way
downward until it is compressed into ice; the ice in
turn is compressed until it assumes that peculiar blue
tint that characterizes ice under great pressure. These
ice streams move slowly down the valleys, about one
foot in twenty-four hours, conforming to their beds.
Where the bed is inclined, the glacier breaks into innumerable
masses, somewhat regular, with great yawning
crevasses between. While crossing one of the
White River glaciers below an ice-fall I had to stand
clear of a dozen bowlders that came rolling down from
the brink, telling very forcibly that the glacier was
moving. These glaciers plow their way down the
valleys to an elevation of between 3000 and 4000 feet,
and there dissolve into water. Some of them terminate
in a gentle incline; others present a high wall of
clear ice, with the river issuing from an immense cave;
still others deposit vast quantities of stones and earth,
forming what is called the "terminal moraine." The
glaciers of the northern peak, five in number, form
the Puyallup and its principal tributary, the Carbon;
the twelve glaciers of the eastern slope of crater peak
yield the icy waters of the White and Cowlitz; the
glaciers of the southern peak form the several
sources of the Nisqually. The glaciers are from one
to two miles in width, and from six to twelve miles
in length. Like the rivers which they form, they
themselves have tributaries. When two glaciers unite,
their inside lateral moraines join and form a medial
moraine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The ascent of Mount Rainier is difficult and dangerous.
Three different parties have reached the
summit from the south side&mdash;namely, Hazard Stevens
and P. B. Van Trump in 1870; P. B. Van Trump,
James Longmire and Mr. Bailey, in 1883; and a party
of seven, of which the writer was the projector, in
August of the present year. A party of three from
Snohomish claim to have reached the summit by the
northeast side in the summer of 1884. Several others
and myself have made two attempts to reach the summit
from that side, but came to an impassable crevasse
at an elevation of about 14,000 feet on both occasions.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 10th of last August a party of
eight gentlemen left Seattle for Yelm with the necessary
equipments and provisions for a two weeks'
sojourn among the eternal hills. At Yelm we secured
the necessary horses to convey our outfit to the snow
line on the south side. The day at Yelm was clear
and beautiful&mdash;Mount Rainier never looked so grand
before. Its three peaks stood out in bold relief against
the sky, while its walls of ice sparkled with resplendent
beauty. During the morning and evening the play of
colors around its base, extending in graduated bands
far towards the zenith, made our artist groan aloud
because of his inability to transfer them to canvas.
It took us three days from the time we left Yelm to
reach the Longmire Mineral Springs. These springs
were discovered by Mr. James Longmire in 1883.
They number twenty-five or more, and are heavily
charged with carbon dioxide and other gases that
combine to make the water a very pleasant drink as
well as a health-giving beverage. Around each spring
is an incrustation of soda compounds deposited by the
water. One spring, over which a rude bath-house has
been constructed, pours forth a large quantity of water
at a temperature of 85° Fahr. A bath in this water is
pleasant and invigorating. The view from the springs
is very beautiful. On the right is the swift flowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Nisqually; on the left, a solid white wall of basaltic
rock rises to a height of nearly one thousand feet;
while in front, seeming only a mile away, Mount
Rainier stands in silent majesty. There were several
visitors at the springs. In the near future these
springs will be sought by hundreds of invalids. We
would gladly have remained at the springs for several
days, but, with the old monarch so near, we could not
delay. The next day found all of the party but two on
the tramp. That day's work was to ascend to Camp
of the Clouds, distant about five miles from the springs.
It was no small task. The trail is steep and rugged, and
has been traveled but little. About three miles from
the springs it crosses the Nisqually. From that point
for a mile it is one of the steepest trails I have ever
traveled. When the top was reached we were regaled
by the sight and odor of flowers that surpassed description
in odor and variety. From this point to Camp of
the Clouds, two miles further on, our path was literally
strewed with beautiful flowers. This entire region
is a paradise for the botanist, and the flowers deserve
a much fuller description.</p>

<p>At last, after four days of hard tramping, we have
reached permanent camp at an elevation of about
6,000 feet. Here we unpack, pitch our tent and turn
our jaded horses loose. Here we wish all our friends
with us, and here we would gladly remain a month in
deep enjoyment of the grandeur and beauty around us,
but our time is limited and our friends far away.</p>

<p>Monday noon, August 14th, we carefully prepare
for the ascent. It is light artillery now&mdash;a pair of
blankets, a small supply of provisions, principally
chocolate, and our Alpine staves complete the outfit.
With cheerful hearts and steady nerves we begin the
climb. It is our purpose to ascend to a height of about
10,000 feet and there make camp for the night. Soon
we pass the timber line. Our pathway now lies over
the eternal snow, broken only by a projecting spur of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the mountain. After five hours of hard climbing, we
come to a ridge covered with sand and pumice. From
the presence of the latter we know it to be a spot comparatively
free from wind, for, on account of the lightness
of the pumice, it is easily blown away. Here we
decide to camp. Two by two we go to work preparing
our beds. This we do by clearing away the loose
stones from a space about three by six feet, stirring the
sand up with our pikes and making a wall of rocks
around the cleared place. After a half hour's toil we
declare our beds prepared. Hastily partaking of a
little chocolate and hardtack, we "turn in," although
the hour is early; but the wind is rising and the sharp,
stinging cold is upon us. After passing a miserable
night, we break camp at 4:30 o'clock. Throwing aside
our blankets and part of our provisions, we begin the
final ascent. Our course takes us along the crest of a
rocky ridge and beneath a perpendicular wall of basalt
over a thousand feet in height. Here the courage of
one of the party failed him, and he concluded to go no
farther. The most dangerous part of the ascent is
along the base of this cliff. The earth pitches at an
angle of 35° from its base, and at three particular
places this incline is not over six feet wide, ending in
a perpendicular jump-off of fifteen hundred feet to the
Nisqually glacier below. After a half hour's crouching
and crawling we get past this dangerous part of our
undertaking. We must now ascend almost perpendicularly
one thousand feet to the top of this wall. Ordinarily
steps have to be cut in the snow and ice, but on
this occasion the snow lay in little drifts that served
as steps. Up this ladder of snow and ice, prepared by
the winds, we climb, pausing every few steps "to take
breath." The top is reached at last. Upon consulting
our barometer we find we are 12,000 feet above
the sea level. A halt is ordered to put six steel brads
in the sole of each boot, to prevent us from slipping
on the ice and hard snow that we must now encounter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>From the crest of this cliff the incline of the mountain
to the summit is less than at any other point and
consequently fewer crevasses, the terror of the mountaineer.
Bracing ourselves for the final effort, we
resumed the march. On account of the continuous
ascent and the rarity of the atmosphere we have to
rest every twenty or thirty steps. Still ascending,
avoiding the crevasses by a zigzag path, we at last
reach the last one, or what might more properly be
called the first crevasse. This crevasse is formed by
the first breaking off of the snow as it begins to slide
down the mountain. The upper side is often a perpendicular
wall of hard snow from ten to fifty feet
high. This same crevasse, for it extends half way
round the mountain, prevented our further progress
on two previous occasions, when attempting to reach
the summit from the northeast slope. Luckily on this
occasion we found a bridge that afforded us a safe
passage over. From this point we can see a clear path
to the summit. Upward we climb to where the rim of
the crater seems but a few hundred feet away. Look!
there is a jet of steam right ahead; one grand effort
and I sit upon the rim of the crater. I shout a word
of triumph which sounds strangely shrill to my companions
below, who, one by one, soon gain my exalted
position. The feeling of triumph that filled the heart
of each one as he gained that sublime height can be
realized by no one who has not been in a similar position.</p>

<p>Space precludes an extensive description of the view
from our elevated position; Washington, Oregon and
the Sound and sea lay below us. A roll of clouds extending
entirely around the horizon somewhat obstructed
the prospect, yet added to the beauty of the
scene. Mts. Baker, Adams, Hood, St. Helens, and
Jefferson appeared above the clouds; the Cascade
and Olympic ranges, Puget Sound and numerous river
basins appeared below, while the smoke of distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
cities completed the scene. Reluctantly turning from
this grand panorama of nature, I gave my attention
to an examination of the craters. There are two,
elliptical in shape, and from one-half to three-fourths of
a mile across. Their rims are bare outside, and in to
an average depth of thirty feet from the crest. This is
owing to the internal heat and escaping steam, which
issues from a hundred jets within the circumference of
the craters. The steam escapes in intermittent jets
from little orifices about three-fourths of an inch in
diameter. The walls of the crater in some places are
quite warm, all of which plainly indicates that Mount
Rainier is a volcano, not extinct but slumbering.</p>

<p>The amount of steam that escapes from the crater
at any one time varies with the atmospheric pressure.
In fact, Mount Rainier is a reliable barometer, foretelling
a storm with certainty. Everyone who has
noted the appearance of the mountain from time to
time is familiar with the peculiar white cloud that is
frequently seen suspended just above the summit,
while no other clouds are in sight. This peculiar
cloud, caused by the condensation of escaping steam,
is called "Rainier's cap," and is the forerunner of a
storm. There was considerable snow in the craters,
but it had the appearance of having recently fallen.
I believe, should it cease to snow for two or three
months, the crater would become entirely bare inside;
but this is not possible, for it snows on Mount Rainier
even in midsummer.</p>

<p>Our party spent about two hours on the summit.
We would gladly have tarried longer, but the clouds
were gradually approaching from all points, and we
did not care to take the chance of spending a night in
the crater. Our descent in some places was even more
dangerous than the ascent, owing to the falling rock.
I recall with a shudder the successful dodging of a
shower of bowlders on their way down from the top of
a cliff two thousand feet above. They were singing as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
merrily as a cannon ball just shot from a thirty-pounder
as they passed my head.</p>

<p>Our party left the summit about two o'clock, and
some of us reached "Camp of the Clouds" by six
o'clock, descending in four hours the same distance
that we were twelve hours in covering on the upward
climb. The names of the party making this very successful
ascent are: John Muir, P. B. Van Trump, A. C.
Warner, D. W. Bass, N. O. Booth, C. V. Piper and
E. S. Ingraham.</p>

XI. EXPLORING THE MOUNTAIN AND ITS GLACIERS, 1896<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> PROFESSOR I. C. RUSSELL</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang">The name of Professor Israel Cook Russell is permanently associated
with Mount Rainier. He was one of America's noted
geologists. He was born near Garrattsville, New York,
on December 10, 1852. Graduating from the University of
the City of New York in 1872, he at once began his career in
science. In 1874, he was a member of the United States party
at Queenstown, New Zealand, to observe the transit of Venus.
From 1878 to 1892, he wrought valuable work in geology for
the United States Geological Survey. This took him to Alaska
and various other parts of the country. He succeeded
Alexander Winchell as Professor of Geology in the University
of Michigan in 1892 and continued to spend his summers in
field work. One of his trips was to the West Indies during the
eruption of Mount Pelee.</p>

<p class="hang">Most of his summer trips were devoted to the mountains and
valleys of Oregon and Washington. It was during one of
these trips, in the summer of 1896, that he made the explorations
of Mount Rainier the extensive record of which, fully
illustrated, appeared in the Eighteenth Annual Report of the
United States Geological Survey for 1896-1897. The essential
portions of that record are here reproduced by permission of
Director George Otis Smith of the Survey, who also kindly
furnished a portrait of his former colleague.</p>

<p class="hang">Professor Russell was honored with the Doctor of Laws degree
by his alma mater and by the University of Wisconsin. He
died suddenly at the zenith of his power in 1906, leaving
a widow, Mrs. J. Augusta (Olmstead) Russell and three
daughters. An earnest appreciation of his character and work
by G. K. Gilbert was published in The Journal of Geology,
Volume XIV, number 8, November-December, 1906. When
The Mountaineers Club ascended the mountain in 1909 they
named in his honor Russell Cliff, a majestic crest near the
summit and overlooking the Winthrop and Emmons glaciers,
and later a glacier on the northern slope, near Carbon Glacier,
was named Russell Glacier.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>The reconnaissance during which the notes for this
essay were obtained began [1896] at Carbonado, a
small coal-mining town about 20 miles southeast of
Tacoma, with which it is connected by a branch of the
Union [Northern] Pacific Railroad. Carbonado is
situated on the border of the unbroken forest. Eastward
to beyond the crest of the Cascade Mountains is
a primeval forest, the density and magnificence of
which it is impossible adequately to describe to one
who is not somewhat familiar with the Puget Sound
region. From Carbonado a trail, cut through the
forest under the direction of Willis in 1881, leads to
Carbon River, a stream flowing from Mount Rainier,
which it formerly crossed by a bridge that is now
destroyed, and thence continues to the west of the
mountain to Busywild. A branch of this trail leads
eastward to the north side of the mountain, making
accessible a beautiful region near the timber line,
known as Spray Park.</p>

<p>Our party consisted of Bailey Willis, geologist in
charge, George Otis Smith and myself, assistants, and
F. H. Ainsworth, Fred Koch, William B. Williams,
and Michael Autier, camp hands.</p>

<p>From Carbonado we proceeded with pack animals
along the Willis trail, already mentioned, to the crossing
of Carbon River. We then left the main trail and
went up the right bank of the river by a trail recently
cut as far as the mouth of Chenuis Creek. At that
locality our party was divided; Willis and myself,
taking blankets, rations, etc., and crossing the river,
proceeded up its bowlder-strewn left bank to the foot
of Carbon Glacier. The remainder of the party cut a
trail along the right bank, and in the course of a few
days succeeded in making a depot of supplies near
where the river emerges from beneath the extremity
of the glacier. The pack train was then taken back to
near Carbonado for pasture.</p>

<p>The tramp from Carbonado to the foot of the Carbon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Glacier was full of interest, as it revealed the characteristics
of a great region, covered with a dense forest,
which is a part of the deeply dissected Tertiary peneplain
surrounding Mount Rainier. The rocks from
Carbonado to Carbon River crossing are coal bearing.
Extensive mines are worked at Carbonado, and
test shafts have been opened at a few localities near
the trail which we followed. At Carbonado the river
flows through a steep-sided canyon about 300 feet
deep. Near where the Willis trail crosses the stream
the canyon broadens, is deeply filled with bowlders,
and is bordered by forest-covered mountains fully 3,000
feet in elevation. On account of the dense forests,
the scenery throughout the region traversed is wild and
picturesque. At a few localities glimpses were obtained
of the great snow-clad dome of Mount Rainier,
rising far over the intervening tree-covered foothills.</p>

<p>The forests of the Puget Sound region are the most
magnificent on the continent. The moist atmosphere
and genial climate have led to a wonderfully luxuriant
growth, especially of evergreens. Huge fir trees and
cedars stand in close-set ranks and shoot upward
straight and massive to heights which frequently exceed
250 feet, and sometimes are even in excess of 300
feet. The trees are frequently 10 to 12 feet or more
in diameter at the height of one's head and rise in massive
columns without a blemish to the first branches,
which are in many instances 150 feet from the ground.
The soil beneath the mighty trees is deeply covered with
mosses of many harmonious tints, and decked with
rank ferns, whose gracefully bending fronds attain a
length of 6 to 8 feet. Lithe, slender maples, termed
vine-maples from their habit of growth, are plentiful,
especially along the small water courses. In many
places the broad leaves of the devil's club (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fatsia horrida</i>)
give an almost tropical luxuriance to the shadowy
realm beneath the lofty canopies formed by the firs
and cedars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>[A quotation from Bailey Willis is omitted, as the
whole article is published in this work&mdash;Chapter IX.]</p></blockquote>

<p>The mighty forest through which we traveled from
Carbonado to the crossing of Carbon River extends
over the country all about Mount Rainier and clothes
the sides of the mountain to a height of about 6,000
feet. From distant points of view it appears as an
unbroken emerald setting for the gleaming, jewel-like
summit of the snow-covered peak.</p>

<p>In spite of the many attractions of the forest, it
was with a sense of relief that we entered the canyon
of Carbon River and had space to see about us. The
river presents features of geographical interest, especially
in the fact that it is filling in its valley. The
load of stone contributed by the glaciers, from which
the stream comes as a roaring turbid flood, is greater
than it can sweep along, and much of its freight is
dropped by the way. The bottom of the canyon is a
desolate, flood-swept area of rounded bowlders, from
100 to 200 yards broad. The stream channel is
continually shifting, and is frequently divided by
islands of bowlders, heaped high during some period
of flood. Many of the stream channels leading away
from Mount Rainier are known to have the characteristics
of the one we ascended, and show that the
canyons were carved under different conditions from
those now prevailing. The principal amount of canyon
cutting must have been done before the streams
were overloaded with débris contributed by glaciers&mdash;that
is, the deep dissection of the lower slope of
Mount Rainier and of the platform on which it stands
must have preceded the Glacial epoch.</p>

<p>After a night's rest in the shelter of the forest, lulled
to sleep by the roar of Carbon River in its tumultuous
course after its escape from the ice caverns, we climbed
the heavily moraine-covered extremity of Carbon
Glacier. At night, weary with carrying heavy packs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
over the chaos of stones that cover the glaciers, we
slept on a couch of moss beautified with lovely blossoms,
almost within the spray of Philo Falls, a cataract
of clear icy water that pours into the canyon of Carbon
Glacier from snow fields high up on the western wall
of the canyon.</p>

<p>I will ask the reader to defer the study of the glaciers
until we have made a reconnaissance of the mountain
and climbed to its summit, as he will then be
better prepared to understand the relation of the
glaciers, névés, and other features with which it will
be necessary to deal. In this portion of our fireside
explorations let us enjoy a summer outing, deferring
until later the more serious task of questioning the
glaciers.</p>

<p>From Philo Falls we ascended still higher, by following
partially snow-filled lanes between the long lateral
moraines that have been left by the shrinking of Carbon
Glacier, and found three parallel, sharp-crested
ridges about a mile long and from 100 to 150 feet high,
made of bowlders and stones of all shapes, which
record the former positions of the glacier. Along
the western border of the oldest and most westerly of
these ridges there is a valley, perhaps 100 yards wide,
intervening between the abandoned lateral moraine
and the western side of the valley, which rises in precipices
to forest-covered heights at least 1,000 feet above.
Between the morainal ridges there are similar narrow
valleys, each of which at the time of our visit, July 15,
was deeply snow-covered. The ridges are clothed with
spruce and cedar trees, together with a variety of
shrubs and flowering annuals. The knolls rising
through the snow are gorgeous with flowers. A
wealth of purple Bryanthus, resembling purple
heather, and of its constant companion, if not near
relative, the Cassiope, with white, waxy bells, closely
simulating the white heather, make glorious the mossy
banks from which the lingering snow has but just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
departed. Acres of meadow land, still soft with snow
water and musical with rills and brooks flowing in
uncertain courses over the deep, rich turf, are beautiful
with lilies, which seemed woven in a cloth of gold
about the borders of the lingering snow banks. We
are near the upper limit of timber growth, where
park-like openings, with thickets of evergreens, give a
special charm to the mountain side. The morainal
ridge nearest the glacier is forest-covered on its outer
slope, while the descent to the glacier is a rough, desolate
bank of stones and dirt. The glacier has evidently
but recently shrunk away from this ridge, which was
formed along its border by stones brought from a
bold cliff that rises sheer from the ice a mile upstream.
Standing on the morainal ridge overlooking the glacier,
one has to the eastward an unobstructed view of
the desolate and mostly stone and dirt covered ice.
Across the glacier another embankment can be seen,
similar to the one on the west, and, like it, recording a
recent lowering of the surface of the glacier of about
150 feet. Beyond the glacier are extremely bold and
rugged mountains, scantily clothed with forests nearly
to their summits. The position of the timber line
shows that the bare peaks above are between 8,000
and 9,000 feet high. Looking southward, up the glacier,
we have a glimpse into the wild amphitheater in
which it has its source. The walls of the great hollow
in the mountain side rise in seemingly vertical
precipices about 4,000 feet high. Far above is a shining,
snow-covered peak, which Willis named the
Liberty Cap. It is one of the culminating points of
Mount Rainier, but not the actual summit. Its elevation
is about 14,300 feet above the sea. Toward the
west the view is limited by the forest-covered morainal
ridges near at hand and by the precipitous slopes
beyond, which lead to a northward-projecting spur of
Mount Rainier, known as the Mother Mountains.
This, our first view of Mount Rainier near at hand, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
shown that the valley down which Carbon Glacier
flows, as well as the vast amphitheater in which it has
its source, is sunk in the flanks of the mountain. To
restore the northern slope of the ancient volcano as it
existed when the mountain was young we should have
to fill the depression in which the glacier lies at least
to the height of its bordering ridges. On looking down
the glacier we see it descending into a vast gulf bordered
by steep mountains, which rise at least 3,000
feet above its bottom. This is the canyon through
which the water formed by the melting of the glacier
escapes. To restore the mountain this great gulf
would also have to be filled. Clearly the traveler
in this region is surrounded by the records of mighty
changes. Not only does he inquire how the volcanic
mountain was formed, but how it is being destroyed.
The study of the glaciers will do much toward making
clear the manner in which the once smooth slopes have
been trenched by radiating valleys, leaving mountain-like
ridges between.</p>

<p>Another line of inquiry which we shall find of interest
as we advance is suggested by the recent shrinkage
of Carbon Glacier. Are all of the glaciers that flow
from the mountain wasting away? If we find this to
be the case, what climatic changes does it indicate?</p>

<p>From our camp among the morainal ridges by the
side of Carbon Glacier we made several side trips,
each of which was crowded with observations of
interest. One of these excursions, made by Mr. Smith
and myself, was up the snow fields near camp; past
the prominent outstanding pinnacles known as the
Guardian Rocks, one red and the other black; and
through Spray Park, with its thousands of groves of
spire-like evergreens, with flower-enameled glades
between. On the bare, rocky shoulder of the mountain,
where the trees now grow, we found the unmistakable
grooves and striations left by former glaciers.
The lines engraved in the rock lead away from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
mountain, showing that even the boldest ridges were
formerly ice-covered. Our route took us around the
head of the deep canyon through which flows Cataract
Creek. In making this circuit we followed a rugged
saw-tooth crest, and had some interesting rock-climbing.
Finally, the sharp divide between Cataract
Creek and a small stream flowing westward to Crater
Lake was reached, and a slide on a steep snow slope
took us quickly down to where the flowers made a
border of purple and gold about the margins of the
snow. Soon we were in the forest, and gaining a
rocky ledge among the trees, could look down on
Crater Lake, deeply sunk in shaggy mountains which
still preserve all of their primitive freshness and beauty.
Snow lay in deep drifts beneath the shelter of the
forest, and the lake was ice-covered except for a few
feet near the margin. This was on July 20. I have
been informed that the lake is usually free of ice
before this date, but the winter preceding our visit
was of more than usual severity, the snowfall being
heavy, and the coming of summer was therefore much
delayed.</p>

<p>The name Crater Lake implies that its waters occupy
a volcanic crater. Willis states that Nature has here
placed an emerald seal on one of Pluto's sally ports;
but that the great depression now water-filled is a
volcanic crater is not so apparent as we might expect.
The basin is in volcanic rock, but none of the characteristics
of a crater due to volcanic explosions can be
recognized. The rocks, so far as I saw them, are
massive lavas, and not fragmental scoriæ or other
products of explosive eruptions. On the bold, rounded
rock ledges down which we climbed in order to reach
the shore, there were deep glacial scorings, showing
that the basin was once deeply filled with moving ice.
My observations were not sufficiently extended to
enable me to form an opinion as to the origin of the
remarkable depression, but whatever may have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
its earlier history, it has certainly been profoundly
modified by ice erosion.</p>

<p>Following the lake shore southward, groping our
way beneath the thick, drooping branches which dip in
the lake, we reached the notch in the rim of the basin
through which the waters escape and start on their
journey to Mowich River and thence to the sea. We
there found the branch of the Willis trail leading to
Spray Park, and turned toward camp. Again we
enjoyed the luxury of following a winding pathway
through silent colonnades formed by the moss-grown
trunks of noble trees. On either side of the trail worn
in the brown soil the ferns and flowering shrubs were
bent over in graceful curves, and at times filled the
little-used lane, first traversed fifteen years before.</p>

<p>The trail led us to Eagle Cliff, a bold, rocky promontory
rising as does El Capitan from the Yosemite, 1,800
feet from the forest-lined canyon of Mowich River.
From Eagle Cliff one beholds the most magnificent
view that is to be had in all the wonderful region about
Mount Rainier. The scene beheld on looking eastward
toward the mighty mountain is remarkable
alike for its magnificence and for the artistic grouping
of the various features of the sublime picture. In the
vast depths at one's feet the tree-tops, through which
the mists from neighboring cataracts are drifting, impart
a somber tone and make the valley's bottom seem
far more remote than it is. The sides of the canyon
are formed by prominent serrate ridges, leading upward
to the shining snow fields of the mighty dome that
heads the valley. Nine thousand feet above our
station rose the pure white Liberty Cap, the crowning
glory of the mountain as seen from the northward.
The snow descending the northwest side of the great
central dome is gathered between the ridges forming
the sides of the valley, and forms a white névé from
which flows Willis Glacier. In looking up the valley
from Eagle Cliff the entire extent of the snow fields
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and of the river-like stream of ice flowing from them is
in full view. The ice ends in a dirt-covered and rock-strewn
terminus, just above a huge rounded dome
that rises in its path. In 1881 the ice reached nearly
to the top of the dome and broke off in an ice cliff, the
detached blocks falling into the gulf below. The
glacier has now withdrawn its terminus well above
the precipice where it formerly fell as an ice cascade,
and its surface has shrunk away from well-defined
moraines in much the same manner as has already
been noted in the case of Carbon Glacier. A more
detailed account of the retreat of the extremity of
Willis Glacier<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> will be given later.</p>

<p>From Eagle Cliff we continued our tramp eastward
along the trail leading to Spray Park, climbed the zigzag
pathway up the face of a cliff in front of Spray
Falls, and gained the picturesque and beautiful parklike
region above. An hour's tramp brought us again
near the Guardian Rocks. A swift descent down the
even snow fields enabled us to reach camp just as the
shadows of evening were gathering in the deeper canyons,
leaving the silent snow fields above all aglow with
reflected sunset tints.</p>

<p>Taking heavy packs on our backs on the morning of
July 21, we descended the steep broken surface of the
most recent moraine bordering Carbon Glacier in its
middle course, and reached the solid blue ice below.
Our course led us directly across the glacier, along the
lower border of the rapidly melting covering of winter
snow. The glacier is there about a mile across. Its
central part is higher than its border, and for the most
part the ice is concealed by dirt and stones. Just
below the névé, however, we found a space about half
a mile long in which melting had not led to the concentration
of sufficient débris to make traveling difficult.
Farther down the glacier, where surface melting was
more advanced, the entire glacier, with the exception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of a few lanes of clear ice between the ill-defined medial
moraines, was completely concealed beneath a desolate
sheet of angular stones. On reaching the east side of
the glacier we were confronted with a wall of clay and
stones, the inner slope of a moraine similar in all respects
to the one we had descended to reach the west
border of the glacier. A little search revealed a locality
where a tongue of ice in a slight embayment projected
some distance up the wall of morainal material, and a
steep climb of 50 or 60 feet brought us to the summit.
The glacier has recently shrunk&mdash;that is, its surface
has been lowered from 80 to 100 feet by melting.</p>

<p>On the east side of the glacier we found several
steep, sharp-crested ridges, clothed with forest trees,
with narrow, grassy, and flower-strewn dells between,
in which banks of snow still lingered. The ridges are
composed of bowlders and angular stones of a great
variety of sizes and shapes, and are plainly lateral
moraines abandoned by the shrinking of the glacier.
Choosing a way up one of the narrow lanes, bordered
on each side by steep slopes densely covered with trees
and shrubs, we found secure footing in the hard granular
snow, and soon reached a more open, parklike
area, covered with mossy bosses of turf, on which grew
a great profusion of brilliant flowers. Before us rose
the great cliffs which partially inclose the amphitheater
in which Carbon Glacier has its source. These
precipices, as already stated, have a height of about
4,000 feet, and are so steep that the snow does not
cling to them, but descends in avalanches. Above the
cliffs, where the inclination is less precipitous, the snow
lies in thick layers, the edges of which are exposed in a
vertical precipice rising above the avalanche-swept
rock-slope below. Far above, and always the central
object in the wild scenery surrounding us, rose the
brilliant white Liberty Cap, one of the pinnacles on
the rim of the great summit crater. Our way then
turned eastward, following the side of the mountain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and led us through a region just above the timber line,
which commands far reaching views to the wild and
rugged mountains to the northeast. This open tract,
leading down to groves of spruce trees and diversified
by charming lakelets, bears abundant evidence of
having formerly been ice-covered, and is known as
Moraine Park.</p>

<p>In order to retain our elevation we crossed diagonally
the steep snow slopes in the upper portion of the
Moraine Park. Midway over the snow we rested at
a sharp crest of rock, and found that it is composed
of light-colored granite. Later we found that much of
the area between the Carbon and Winthrop glaciers
is composed of this same kind of rock. Granite forms
a portion of the border of the valley through which
flow the glaciers just named, and furnished them with
much granitic débris, which is carried away as moraines
and later worked over into well-rounded bowlders by
the streams flowing from the ice. The presence of
granite pebbles in the course of Carbon and White
rivers, far below the glaciers, is thus accounted for.</p>

<p>A weary tramp of about 4 miles from the camp we
had left brought us to the border of Winthrop Glacier.
In the highest grove of trees, which are bent down and
frequently lie prone on the ground, although still living,
we selected a well-sheltered camping-place. Balsam
boughs furnished luxuriant beds, and the trees
killed by winter storms enabled us to have a roaring
camp fire. Fresh trail of mountain goats and their but
recently abandoned bed showed that this is a favorite
resort for those hardy animals. Marmots were also
abundant, and frequently awakened the echoes with
their shrill, whistling cries. The elevation of our
camp was about 8,000 feet.</p>

<p>From our camp on the cliffs above the west border
of Winthrop Glacier we made excursions across that
glacier and to its heavily moraine-covered extremity.
The snow mantle that is spread over the region about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Mount Rainier each winter melts first on the rugged
plateau surrounding the base of the mountain, and,
as the summer's heat increases, gradually withdraws
up the mountain sides, but never so as to uncover the
more elevated region. The snow line&mdash;that is, the
position to which the lower border of the mantle of
perennial snow withdraws late in summer&mdash;has an
elevation of about 9,000 feet. The lower margin of the
wintry covering is always irregular, however, extending
farthest down on the glaciers and retreating highest
on the rocks. At the time of our visit the snow had
melted off of nearly all the region below our camp,
leaving only dirt-stained snow banks in the more completely
sheltered recesses and in deeply shaded dells
in the adjacent forests. On the glaciers all the region
at a greater elevation than our camp was white and
free from dirt and stones, while the hard glacial ice
was abundantly exposed at lower altitudes and ended
in a completely moraine-covered terminus. Above
us all was barren, white, and wintry; below lay the
flowery vales and grass parks, warm and inviting,
leading to the welcome shade of noble forests. Our
course led upward into the frozen region.</p>

<p>On leaving the camp on the border of Winthrop
Glacier we began our alpine work. There were five
in the party selected for the difficult task of scaling
Mount Rainier; namely: Willis, Smith, Ainsworth,
Williams, and myself. Taking our blankets, a small
supply of rations, an alcohol lamp, alpenstocks, a rope
100 feet long to serve as a life line, and a few other
articles necessary for traveling above timber line, we
began the ascent of Winthrop Glacier early on the
morning of July 23. Our route was comparatively
easy at the start, but became steeper and steeper as
we advanced. The snow was firm and, except for the
numerous crevasses, presented no great difficulties to
be overcome. In several places the névé rises in domes
as if forced up from beneath, but caused in reality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
by bosses of rock over which the glacier flows. These
domes are broken by radiating crevasses which intersect
in their central portions, leaving pillars and castle-like
masses of snow with vertical sides. At one locality,
in attempting to pass between two of these shattered
domes, we found our way blocked by an impassable
crevasse. Considerable time was lost in searching for
a practicable upward route, but at length, by making
a detour to the right, we found a way which, although
steep, allowed us to pass the much crevassed area and
gain the sharp ridge of rock which divides the névé
snow flowing from the central dome of the mountain,
and marks the separation between Winthrop and
Emmons glaciers. This prow-like promontory, rising
some 500 feet above the glaciers on either hand,
we named The Wedge. This is the upward pointing,
acute angle of a great V-shaped portion of the lower
slope of the mountain, left in bold relief by the erosion
of the valleys on either side. As will be described
later, there are several of these remnants about the
sides of the mountain at the same general horizon,
which record a somewhat definite stage in the destruction
of the mountain by ice erosion.</p>

<p>On reaching The Wedge we found it an utterly desolate
rocky cape in a sea of snow. We were at an altitude
of about 10,000 feet, and far above timber.
Water was obtained by spreading snow on smooth
rocks or on rubber sheets, and allowing it to melt by
the heat of the afternoon sun. Coffee was prepared
over the alcohol lamp, sheltered from the wind by a
bed sheet supported by alpenstocks. After a frugal
lunch, we made shelf-like ledges in a steep slope of
earth and stones and laid down our blankets for the
night. From sheltered nooks amid the rocks, exposed
to the full warmth of the declining sun, we had the icy
slopes of the main central dome of the mountain in full
view and chose what seemed the most favorable route
for the morrow's climb.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Surrounded as we were by the desolation and solitude
of barren rocks, on which not even a lichen had
taken root, and pure white snow fields, we were much
surprised to receive passing visits from several humming-birds
which shot past us like winged jewels.
They came up the valley occupied by the Emmons
Glacier, turned sharply at The Wedge, and went down
the way of the Winthrop Glacier. What tempts these
children of the sunlight and the flowers into the frozen
regions seems a mystery. That the humming-birds
are bold explorers was not new to me, for the reason
that on several occasions in previous years, while on
the snow-covered slopes of Mount St. Elias, far above
all vestiges of vegetation, my heart had been gladdened
by glimpses of their brilliant plumage.</p>

<p>When the sun declined beyond the great snow-covered
dome that towered above us, and the blue
shadows crept down the previously dazzling cliffs, the
air became cold and a strong wind made our perch on
the rocks uncomfortable. Wrapping ourselves in our
blankets we slept until the eastern sky began to glow
with sunrise tints.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of July 24 [1896] we began the
climb of the steep snow slopes leading to the summit of
the mountain. Roped together as we had been on the
previous day, we slowly worked our way upward, in a
tortuous course, in order to avoid the many yawning
crevasses. The way was steep and difficult. Some
members of the party felt the effects of the rarefied
air, and as we lacked experience in true alpine work our
progress was slow and laborious. Many of the crevasses
that our course crossed were of the nature of
faults. Their upper rims stood several feet above
their lower margins, and thus added to the difficulty
of passing them. Our aim at first was to traverse the
névé of Emmons Glacier and gain the less rugged slope
bordering it on the south, but the intervening region
was greatly broken and, as we found after several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
approaches to it, utterly impassable. The climb presented
no special difficulties other than the extreme
fatigue incident to climbing steep snow slopes, especially
while attached to a life line, and the delays necessitated
by frequently turning and retracing our steps
in order to get around wide crevasses.</p>

<p>Once while crossing a steep snow slope diagonally,
and having a wide crevasse below us, Ainsworth, who
was next to the rear of the line, lost his footing and slid
down the slope on his back. Unfortunately, at that
instant, Williams, who was at the rear of the line,
removed his alpenstock from the snow, was overturned
by the pull on the line, and shot headfirst down the
slope and disappeared over the brink of the crevasse.
A strong pull came on the members of the party who
were in advance, but our alpenstocks held fast, and
before assistance could be extended to the man dangling
in midair, he climbed the taut rope and stood
unhurt among us once more. The only serious result of
the accident was the loss of an alpenstock.</p>

<p>Pressing on toward the dark rim of rock that we
could now and then catch glimpses of at the head of
the snow slopes and which we knew to be the outer
portion of the summit crater, we crossed many frail
snow bridges and climbed precipitous slopes, in some of
which steps had to be cut. As we neared the summit
we met a strong westerly gale that chilled us and benumbed
our fingers. At length, weary and faint on
account of the rarity of the air, we gained the lower
portion of the rim of stones marking the position of
the crater. While my companions rested for a few
moments in the shelter of the rocks, I pressed on up
the rugged slope and gained the top of the rim.</p>

<p>The stones exposed at the summit are bare of snow,
possibly on account of the heat from below, and are
rounded and their exposed surfaces polished. The
smooth, black bowlders shine in the sunlight much
the same as the sand-burnished stones in desert regions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Here on the mountain's brow, exposed to an almost
continuous gale, the rocks have been polished by drifting
snow crystals. The prevailing rounded form that
the stones present may be the result of weathering,
or possibly is due to the manner in which the fragments
were ejected from the volcano. My hasty examinations
suggested the former explanation.</p>

<p>Descending into the crater, I discovered crevices
from which steam was escaping, and on placing my
hands on the rocks was rejoiced to find them hot.
My companions soon joined me, and we began the
exploration of the crater, our aim being to find the least
uncomfortable place in which to take refuge from the
freezing blast rather than to make scientific discoveries.</p>

<p>The crater that we had entered is one of the smaller
and more recent ones in the truncated summit of the
peak, and is deeply filled with snow, but the rim is
bare and well defined. The steam and heat from the
rocks have melted out many caverns beneath the snow.
In one of these we found shelter.</p>

<p>The cavern we chose in which to pass the night,
although irregular, was about 60 feet long by 40 wide,
and had an arched ceiling some 20 feet high. The snow
had been melted out from beneath, leaving a roof so
thin that a diffused blue light penetrated the chamber.
The floor sloped steeply, and on the side toward the
center of the crater there was a narrow space between
the rocks and the descending roof which led to unexplored
depths. As a slide into this forbidding gulf would
have been exceedingly uncomfortable, if not serious,
our life line was stretched from crag to crag so as to
furnish a support and allow us to walk back and forth
during the night without danger of slipping. Three
arched openings or doorways communicated with other
chambers, and through these drafts of cold air were
continually blowing. The icy air chilled the vapor
rising from the warm rocks and filled the chamber with
steam which took on grotesque forms in the uncertain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
fading light. In the central part of the icy chamber
was a pinnacle of rock, from the crevices of which steam
was issuing with a low hissing sound. Some of the
steam jets were too hot to be comfortable to the ungloved
hand. In this uninviting chamber we passed
the night. The muffled roar of the gale as it swept over
the mountain could be heard in our retreat and made
us thankful for the shelter the cavern afforded.</p>

<p>The floor of our cell was too uneven and too steeply
inclined to admit of lying down. Throughout the
night we leaned against the hot rocks or tramped
wearily up and down holding the life line. Cold
blasts from the branching ice chambers swept over us.
Our clothes were saturated with condensed steam.
While one side of the body resting against the rocks
would be hot, the strong drafts of air with a freezing
temperature chilled the other side. After long hours
of intense darkness the dome of snow above us became
faintly illuminated, telling that the sun was again
shining. After a light breakfast and a cup of tea,
prepared over our alcohol lamp, we resumed our exploration,
none the worse for the exposures of the night.</p>

<p>Following the inner rim of the crater so as to be
sheltered from the gale still blowing steadily from the
west, we gained its northern border and climbed to the
topmost pinnacle, known as Columbia's Crest. This
pinnacle rises about 50 feet above the general level of
the irregular rim of the crater, and is the highest point
on the mountain. Its elevation, as previously stated,
is 14,526 feet.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The magnificent view described by former visitors
to this commanding station, which we had hoped would
reward our efforts, was concealed beneath a canopy of
smoke that covered all of the region about the mountain
to a depth of about 10,000 feet. The surface of the
layer of smoke was sharply defined, and appeared like
an undulating sea surrounding the island on which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
we stood. Far to the northward rose the regular
conical summit of Mount Baker, like an isolated sea-girt
island. A few of the rugged and more elevated
summits, marking the course of the Cascade Mountains,
could be discerned to the eastward. The summits
of Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens were in
plain view and seemingly near at hand. All of the
forest-covered region between these elevated summits
was blotted out by the dense, heavy layer of smoke, which
rose until it met the westerly gale of the upper regions.</p>

<p>During the ascent of Mount Rainier by Emmons
and Wilson, previously referred to, more favorable
atmospheric conditions prevailed than at the time of
my visit, and the region about the base of the mountain
was clearly revealed. In describing the view
from the summit Emmons says:</p>

<blockquote><p>From the northeastern rim of the crater we could look down an
unbroken slope of nearly 10,000 feet to the head of the White
River, the upper half or two-thirds of which was so steep that one
had the feeling of looking over a perpendicular wall. [It was up
this slope that the climb briefly described above was made.]
The systems of glaciers and the streams which flowed from them
lay spread out as on a map at our feet; radiating out in every
direction from the central mass, they all with one accord curve to
the westward to send their waters down toward Puget Sound or
the Lower Columbia. [Attention has already been directed to
the westward curvature of the streams from Mount Rainier on
reaching the tilted peneplain on which the mountain stands, and
the explanation has been suggested that they are consequent
streams the direction of which was determined by the original
slope of the now deeply dissected plateau.]</p>

<p>Looking to the more distant country, the whole stretch of Puget
Sound, seeming like a pretty little lake embowered in green,
could be seen in the northwest, beyond which the Olympic Mountains
extend out into the Pacific Ocean. The Cascade Mountains,
lying dwarfed at our feet, could be traced northward into British
Columbia, and southward into Oregon, while above them, at
comparatively regular intervals, rose the ghost-like forms of our
companion volcanoes. To the eastward the eye ranged for hundreds
of miles over chain on chain of mountain ridges, which
gradually disappeared in the dim, blue distance.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>In the truncated summit of Mount Rainier there are
three craters. The largest one, partially filled by the
building of the two others, is the oldest, and has suffered
so greatly from subsequent volcanic explosions
and erosion that no more than its general outline can
be traced. Peak Success and Liberty Cap are prominent
points on the rim of what remains of this huge
crater. Its diameter, as nearly as can be judged, is
about 2&#189; miles. Within the great crater, in the formation
of which the mountain was truncated and, as
previously stated, lost fully 2,000 feet of its summit,
there are two much smaller and much more recent
craters. The larger of these, the one in which we took
refuge, is about 300 yards in diameter, and the second,
which is an incomplete circle, its rim having been
broken by the formation of its more recent companion,
is perhaps 200 yards across. The rim of each now
partially snow-filled bowl is well defined, and rises
steeply from within to a sharp crest. The character
of the inner slopes shows that much rocky material
has been detached and has fallen into the cavities
from which it was ejected. The rock in the crater
walls is in fragments and masses, some of them well
rounded and probably of the nature of volcanic bombs.
In each of the smaller craters there are numerous
steam jets. These show that the rock below is still
hot, and that water percolating downward is changed
to steam. These steam jets evidently indicate the
presence of residual heat and not an actual connection
with a volcanic center deep below the surface.
All the evidence available tends to show that Rainier
is an extinct volcano. It belongs, however, to the
explosive type of volcanoes, of which Vesuvius is the
best-known example, and there is no assurance that
its energies may not be reawakened.</p>

<p>In descending we chose the south side of the mountain,
knowing from the reports of many excursionists
who had ascended the peak from that direction that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
a practicable route could probably be found. Threading
our way between numerous crevasses we soon came
in sight of a bold, outstanding rock mass, which we
judged to be Gibraltar, and succeeded in reaching it
with but little difficulty. On gaining the junction of
the rock with the snow fields rising above it, we found
evidences of a trail, which was soon lost, however, and
only served to show that our general course was the
right one. A deep, narrow space between the border
of Nisqually Glacier and the precipitous side of Gibraltar,
from which the snow and ice had been melted
by the heat reflected from the cliffs on our left, led us
down to a shelf on the lower side of the promontory,
which proved a safe and easy way to the crest of a
rocky rib on the mountain side which extended far
down toward the dark forests in view below.</p>

<p>Gibraltar is a portion of the cone of Rainier built
before the explosion which truncated the mountain.
It is an outstanding and very prominent rock mass,
left in bold relief by the ice excavation which has
carved deep valleys on each side. The rock divides
the descending névé in the same manner as does The
Wedge, and causes a part of the snow drainage to flow
to the Cowlitz and the other part to be tributary to
the Nisqually Glacier. The rocks forming Gibraltar
consist largely of fragments ejected from the crater
above, but present a rude stratification due to the
presence of lava flows. When seen from the side and
at a convenient distance, it is evident that the planes
of bedding, if continued upward at the same angle,
would reach above the present summit of the mountain.
Gibraltar, like The Wedge, and several other secondary
peaks on the sides of Mount Rainier, are, as previously
explained, the sharp, upward-pointing angles of large
V-shaped masses of the original volcanic cone, left in
bold relief by the excavation of deep valleys radiating
from the central peak. On the backs, so to speak, of
these great V-shaped portions of the mountain which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
now seem to rest against the central dome, secondary
glaciers, or interglaciers as they may be termed, have
excavated valleys and amphitheaters. In the V-shaped
mass of which Gibraltar is the apex, a broad amphitheater-like
depression has been cut out, leaving a bold
cliff above it. The excavation of the amphitheater
did not progress far enough up the mountain to cut
away the apex of the V-shaped mass, but left it with a
precipice on its lower side. This remnant is Gibraltar.
An attempt will be made later to describe more fully
the process of glacial erosion of a conical mountain,
and to show that the secondary topographic features
of Mount Rainier are not without system, as they
appear at first view, but really result from a process
which may be said to have a definite end in view.</p>

<p>Below Gibraltar the descent was easy. Our life
line was no longer needed. Tramping in single file
over the hard surfaces of the snow field, remnants of
the previous winter's snow, we made rapid progress,
and about noon gained the scattered groves of spruce
trees which form such an attractive feature of Paradise
Park.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we found Prof. E. S. Ingraham, of
Seattle, and a party of friends, including several ladies,
encamped in Paradise Park, and the hospitality of the
camp was extended to us. During the afternoon we
basked in the warm sunshine, and in the evening
gathered about a roaring campfire and enjoyed the
society of our companions, who were enthusiastic in
their praise of the wonderful scenes about their camp.</p>

<p>The southern side of Mount Rainier is much less
precipitous than its northern face, and the open park-like
region near timber line is broader, more diversified,
and much more easy of access. The general
elevation of the park is between 5,000 and 7,000 feet,
and it is several thousand acres in extent. Its boundaries
are indefinite. It merges into the heavily forested
region to the south, and into more alpine regions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
on the side toward the mountain, which towers above it
on the north. To the east it is bordered by Cowlitz
Glacier, and on the west by Nisqually Glacier. Each
of these fine ice rivers descends far below timber line.
The small interglacier, known as the Paradise Glacier,
may be considered as lying within the limits of the
park.</p>

<p>Paradise Park presents many and varied charms. It
is a somewhat rugged land, with a deep picturesque
valley winding through it. The trees grow in isolated
groves. Each bunch of dark-green firs and balsams
is a cluster of gracefully tapering spires. The undulating
meadows between the shady groves are brilliant
in summer with a veritable carpet of gorgeous blossoms.
In contrast to the exquisite charms of the
groves and flower-decked rolling meadows are desolate
ice fields and rugged glaciers which vary, through
many tints and shades, from silvery whiteness to intense
blue. Added to these minor charms, and towering
far above them, is the massive summit of Rainier.
At times the sublime mountain appears steel blue in
the unclouded sky, or rosy with the afterglow at sunset,
or all aflame with the glories of the newborn day.
Clouds gather about the lofty summit and transform
it into a storm king. Avalanches rushing down its
side awaken the echoes in the neighboring forest.
The appearance of the mountain is never the same on
different days; indeed, it changes its mood and exerts a
varying influence on the beholder from hour to hour.</p>

<p>While the central attraction to the lover of mountain
scenery in Paradise Park is the vast snow-covered
dome of Mount Rainier, there are other mountains in
view that merit attention. To the east rises the
serrate and rugged Tattoosh range, which is remarkable
for the boldness with which its bordering slopes
rise from the forested region about it and the angularity
of its many serrate summits. This range has never
been explored except by miners and hunters, who have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
made no record of their discoveries. It is virgin ground
to the geologist and geographer. Distant views suggest
that the Tattoosh Mountains have been sculptured
from a plateau, probably an upraised peneplain
in which there existed a great mass of igneous rock
rounded by less resistant Tertiary sediments. The
softer rocks have been removed, leaving the harder and
more resistant ones in bold relief, to become sculptured
by rain and frost into a multitude of angular
peaks. This attractive, and as yet unstudied, group
of peaks is in plain view from Paradise Park, and may
be easily reached from there by a single day's tramp.
Many other delightful excursions are open to one who
pitches his tent in the alpine meadows on the south
side of Mount Rainier.</p>

XII. McCLURE'S ACHIEVEMENT AND TRAGIC DEATH, 1897<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> HERBERT L. BRUCE <span class="smcap">and</span>
PROFESSOR H. H. McALISTER</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang">Visitors to Paradise Valley, who climb above the Camp of the
Clouds to the snowfields, are sure to be attracted to McClure
Rock. It is the scene of one of the mountain's earliest
tragedies, in which Professor Edgar McClure of the University
of Oregon lost his life. He was trying to measure accurately
the height of the great mountain as he had already done for
Mount Adams and other peaks.</p>

<p class="hang">The record of his extensive observations was computed with the
greatest care by his colleague, Professor H. H. McAlister of
the University of Oregon. An account of the work so tragically
ended was prepared by Herbert L. Bruce. Both articles were
published in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer for November 7,
1897, from which paper they are here reproduced. The portrait
of Professor McClure is furnished by his brother, Horace
McClure, editorial writer for the Seattle Daily Times.</p>

<p class="hang">The height of the mountain, 14,528 feet, thus obtained, remained
in use until 1914, when the United States Geological Survey
announced its new and latest findings to be 14,408 feet.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most tragic incidents in modern science
was the death of Professor Edgar McClure, who lost
his life on Mount Rainier July 27, 1897. Occupying,
as he did, the chair of chemistry in the University of
Oregon, his personal tastes, instincts and ambitions
were essentially scientific. In addition to this he was a
member of the Mazamas, whose purposes in the line
of scientific exploration have lent a romantic interest
and a cumulative value to the geography of the northwest.
The particular expedition with which Professor
McClure was associated when he met his untimely
death, left Portland with the distinct object of making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the ascent of Mount Rainier, recording such geographical
and topographical observations as might be
feasible. As a member of the expedition Professor
McClure was placed in charge of the elevation department
and set before himself a somewhat more distinct
and definite purpose, viz., to ascertain by the most
approved methods and with the most accurately graduated
instruments the precise height of the famous and
beautiful mountain. How well he accomplished this
purpose will best appear in the subjoined letter from
Professor E. H. McAlister, his friend and colleague,
who with infinite care and sympathetic zeal has worked
out the data, which would otherwise have been undecipherable
not only to the general public but to the
average scholar. As he himself said when he had completed
his arduous task: "I have done everything
possible to wring the truth from the observations. In
my judgment they should become historic on account
of the probability of their great accuracy."</p>

<p>To the accomplishment of this object Professor
McClure brought all the varied resources of a ripe culture
and an ardent, vigorous young manhood. His
plans were all laid with the greatest care. To him their
fulfillment meant not so much a personal or selfish
triumph as a victory for science. The very instrument
on which he most relied for accurate determinations,
as will be seen from Professor McAlister's statement,
was not only hallowed by scientific associations, but
was prepared for its high mission more lovingly and
assiduously than a favorite racer would be groomed
for the course. Twice had it looked upon the beauties
of the Columbia river from the summit of Mount
Hood, and on three other lofty peaks it had served its
silent but efficient ministry to the cause of science. On
one of these, Mount Adams, the altitude determined
with this instrument was accepted by the United States
government, yet a new tube was filled for it, Professor
McClure himself preparing the mercury by distillation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and seeing to it that the vacuum was exceptionally
perfect. That the barometer was most carefully
handled at the time of observation will fully appear
from the record below. It was suspended by a ring
and allowed to hang until it had assumed the temperature
of the surrounding air before being read. Not
only this, but all the subsidiary phenomena which
could have the slightest bearing on the result were
laboriously determined. Concurrent observations were
made at all salient surrounding stations, while for a
week before the date of actual observation Professor
McClure himself had made numerous observations both
of pressure and of temperature at various sub-stations
in the vicinity of Mount Rainier, and his collaborateur
has secured simultaneous observations from Seattle and
Portland. Uniting as he did the fervor of the pioneer
explorer with the accuracy of the laboratory chemist,
Professor McClure was peculiarly fitted to obtain a
result which bids fair to become historic.</p>

<p>The broken barometer will appeal powerfully to
every lover of science. If, as has been suggested, a
monument be reared to mark the spot where the young
scientist gave up his life, no fitter design could be
adopted than a stone shaft bearing on its face a bas-relief
of the historic instrument which he bore on his
back with sacred care. It is entirely probable that
this barometer, coupled with his unselfish solicitude for
the safety of other members of the expedition, was the
immediate cause of his death. He carried it in a double
case; a wooden one which his own hands had constructed,
and outside of this a strong leather tube.
From the latter stout thongs enabled him to strap the
instrument on his back, much as a pioneer huntsman
would wear his trusty rifle. While standing on the
perilous ledge whence he took the fatal plunge, he
turned to sound warning to his companions whom he
was leading in a search for the lost pathway down the
mountain. "Don't come down here; it is too steep,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
he called, turning so as to make his voice more audible.
These were his last words. He vanished in the night
and the abyss. It is likely that the tube, three and a
half feet in length, caught as he turned and helped to
hurl him from his precarious footing. Like his own
high strung frame, the delicate instrument was
shattered; but neither of the twain went away from
the world without leaving an imperishable record.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the close correspondence of
his independent observations with those made by
others. The height of the mountain had been measured
many times before he essayed to measure it.
Some observers had measured it by triangulation, and
others, notably Major E. S. Ingraham, of Seattle, had
given its altitude from the readings of mercurial barometers.
Major Ingraham gave the height at 14,524
feet. It will be noticed that the result obtained by
Professor McClure was just four feet greater, a remarkable
coincidence at that vast altitude and among
conditions of hardship, exposure and uncertainty.
Prior to Professor McClure's record, the latest measurement
of Rainier had been made by George F. Hyde,
of the United States Geological Survey, in 1896. He
pursued the method of triangulation, and, taking as his
base a line at Ellensburg, in connection with the sea
level gauge at Tacoma, he figured out the extreme
height of Rainier at 14,519 feet.</p>

<p>The value of Professor McClure's determination
will be heightened rather than lessened by the peculiar
difficulty and rareness of scientific work in an unexplored
territory and from a base which has not all the
appurtenances and advantages of the older scientific
stations of the East and of Europe. In this respect
his work is like that of Agassiz and of Audubon. Not
unlike those great masters was he in his intense and
lofty devotion to science. Not unlike them he wrought
with rigid accuracy where others had worked almost
at random. Not unlike them he aroused among his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
friends and students the conviction that he was a born
high priest of nature, whose chief mission in the world
was to reveal her secrets to mankind. He offered up
his life virtually a sacrifice to the cause of popular and
practical science, and in as lofty a sense as ever dignified
a Roman arena he was a martyr to the cause of truth.
To use the matchless figure employed by Byron in
describing the death of Henry Kirk White, who died a
victim to his own passionate devotion to literary art,
he was like the struck eagle whose own feather "winged
the shaft that quivered in his heart."</p>

<p>Just in harmony with this thought came countless
expressions of sympathy and condolence to the members
of Professor McClure's family when the sad news of
his death went abroad. One of the most touching,
and, to my mind, one of the most typical of all these
came from an obscure man in an obscure corner of
Kentucky. He was not a great man himself, as the
world counts greatness, this man in Kentucky; but
he knew a great man when he saw him. He had known
Edgar McClure; and when he heard the circumstances
of his death he sat down and wrote a brief note. One
sentence in it was worthy of Whittier or Emerson. It
was this: "Edgar McClure died as he had always lived&mdash;on
the mountain top."</p>

<p>In transmitting his results to Horace McClure,
brother of the deceased scientist, Professor McAlister
brings to a proper close a labor of love, one that is as
creditable to his scholarly culture as it is to his unselfish
and devoted friendship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Horace McClure</span>&mdash;Dear Sir: I herewith
transmit to you for publication my report upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
observations of your late brother, Professor Edgar
McClure, relative to the altitude of Mount Rainier,
the data having been referred to me for reduction and
computation by yourself and by the officials of the
Mazama Club.</p>

<p>It is but just to myself to say that the long delay
in the appearance of this report has been caused by unavoidable
difficulties in the collection of subsidiary
data; in particular, the comparison sheet showing the
instrumental error of Professor McClure's barometer
could not be found until the 9th of this month, when
it was discovered among some effects left by him in
Portland. A further delay has been occasioned in
obtaining a few other important data. A report approximately
correct could have been made some time
ago, but I felt it was due to the memory of Professor
McClure's reputation for extreme accuracy that no
report whatever should be published until I was able to
state a result for which I could vouch as being the very
best that the observations were capable of affording.</p>

<p>The thanks of all concerned are due to Mr. B. S.
Pague, Director of the Oregon Weather Bureau, for
numerous courtesies and for his efficient aid in the
collection of data.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="smcap">The Result</span></p>

<p>For the benefit of those not interested in the scientific
details of this report, it may be stated at once that
the summit of Mount Rainier, according to Professor
McClure's observations, is 14,528 feet above sea level.
The altitudes of various sub-stations occupied en route
will be found further on. An account of the data,
with description of the methods employed in reduction
and computation, is given, to indicate the degree of
reliance to be placed upon the result.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal observation to which this report refers
was made by Professor Edgar McClure, of the University
of Oregon, on the summit of Mount Rainier,
Washington, July 27, 1897, at 4:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, Pacific standard
time. The observation consists of a reading of Green's
standard mercurial barometer, No. 1612, together with
readings of attached and detached thermometers. It
appears that the barometer, which was suspended by
a ring at the top, was allowed so to hang until it had
assumed the temperature of the surrounding air, before
being read; that the sky was clear at the time;
and that the place of observation, the highest on the
mountain, is designated as Columbia Crest.</p>

<p>The barometric reading, corrected for instrumental
error and temperature, was 17.708 inches; the air
temperature was 29 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Concurrent observations were made at 9:30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
and hourly during the afternoon by the regular
observers at Seattle, Portland, Fort Canby, the University
of Oregon at Eugene, Roseburg, and one observation
at Walla Walla at 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>In addition to these, during the week preceding the
27th Professor McClure made numerous observations
both of pressure and temperature at various sub-stations
in the vicinity of Mount Rainier, and simultaneous
observations are furnished from Seattle and Portland.</p>

<p>At the very outset of the work of reduction it was
evident that Eugene and Roseburg were under an
area of relatively low barometric pressure on the 27th,
representing atmospheric conditions that did not prevail
in the region of Mount Rainier. I therefore
rejected the observations at both these places, using
only those at Seattle, Portland, Fort Canby and Walla
Walla. The strategic position of these four points
will be seen at once by a glance at the map.</p>

<p>The method followed in making the reduction was,
in brief, to deduce from the observations at the four
base stations surrounding the mountain the actual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
atmospheric conditions prevailing in the immediate
region of the mountain. More specifically, the process
consisted in determining the atmospheric pressure
and temperature at an imaginary sea level vertically
under the mountain, which level I shall subsequently
call the "mean base."</p>

<p>In this I was greatly assisted by a careful study of
the daily weather charts issued by the government,
Mr. Pague having kindly loaned me his official file for
July. I thus practically had at my disposal observations
from all the important points on the Coast, both
before and after the principal observation. With due
regard to the position and direction of the isobars,
and giving proper weight to the observations at each
of the four base stations, I finally deduced 30.130 inches
as the value of the pressure at the mean base which
best satisfied all the data. It ought to be said, perhaps,
that this result does not depend upon my judgment to
any appreciable extent, but was legitimately worked
out from the observations and isobaric lines.</p>

<p>In determining the mean temperature of the air
column extending from the mean base to the summit
of the mountain, the observations made by Professor
McClure during the previous week in the vicinity were
so numerous and well timed as to leave far less than
the usual amount of uncertainty. Making due allowance
for the moderate elevations of the stations, these
observations show clearly that the temperature about
the mountain at that time followed that of Seattle
very closely, and was also not much different from that
of Portland, but departed notably from both the heat
of Walla Walla and the low temperature of Fort
Canby. Allowing proper weight to these facts, the
observations at the base stations, with that of Professor
McClure at the summit, gave 49 degrees Fahrenheit
as the mean temperature of the air column.</p>

<p>I regard the method of reduction outlined above as
possessing decided advantages over any other that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
could be applied to the problem in hand; especially
because it admits of using the isobaric charts with
great freedom and effectiveness, thereby increasing the
reliability of the result to a marked extent.</p>

<p>The reduction made, there remained for the final
calculation the following data:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Barometric pressure at the summit of Rainier</td><td class="tdr">17.708 inches</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Barometric pressure at mean base</td><td class="tdr">30.130 inches</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Mean temperature of air column</td><td class="tdr">49 deg. F.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Latitude of Mount Rainer</td><td class="tdr">46 deg. 48 min.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In making the calculation I used the amplified form
of Laplace's formula given in the recent publications
of the Smithsonian Institution, with the constants
there adopted. Perhaps for the general reader it
may be important to remark that this formula, besides
the barometric pressures, contains corrections for the
temperature of the air column; for latitude, and for
the variation of gravity with altitude in its effect on
the weight of the mercury in the barometer; for the
average humidity of the air; and for the variation of
gravity with altitude in its effect on the weight of the
air. I used the latest edition of the Smithsonian
tables, but afterward verified the result by a numerical
solution of the formula&mdash;the altitude being, as stated
at the beginning, 14,528 feet above sea level.</p>

<p>It should be noted as an evidence of the great care
and foresight with which Professor McClure planned
his work and the success with which he carried it out,
that the result of his observations agrees within nine
feet with that obtained by the United States Geological
Survey in 1895, using, as we may suppose, the most
refined methods of triangulation&mdash;the latter estimate
being 14,519 feet. In connection with so great an
altitude, nine feet is an insignificant quantity, and the
close correspondence in the results of the two methods
of measurement is truly remarkable. I am not inclined
to regard it as accidental, but as due to the most careful
work in both cases.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Having a full knowledge of all the available data,
I am perhaps better prepared than anyone else to pass
judgment upon the result set forth; and while it would
be folly to give a numerical estimate of the probable
error, I feel justified in saying that no single barometric
determination is ever likely to prove more accurate
than this one of Professor McClure's. At any rate,
the outstanding error is now too small to justify the
hazard of any future attempts.</p>

<p>From the observations made by Professor McClure
while en route to the summit, together with simultaneous
records from Seattle and Portland, the following
altitudes are obtained:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">&nbsp;</td><td class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Feet above Sea Level</span></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Kernahan's ranch</td><td class="tdr">1,880</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">South side Crater Rainier</td><td class="tdr">14,275</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The data in these cases were not sufficient to admit an
elaborate working-out of the altitude, so that the figures
given are to be regarded as rather close approximations,
except in the case of Mazama camp, the altitude of
which rests upon four observations and is correspondingly
reliable.</p>

<p>Professor McClure's barometer had a notable history
in mountaineering. To quote the professor's
own words:</p>

<p>"It has twice looked upon the beauties of the Columbia
river from the summit of Mount Hood. It was the
first barometer taken to the top of Mount Hood, and
gave the true elevation, 11,225 feet, in place of 17,000
or 18,000 feet previously claimed. This barometric
measurement of Mount Hood was made in August,
1867, by a government party under the direction of
Lieutenant R. S. Williamson. The second barometric
measurement of Mount Hood was made with the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
instrument in August, 1870, by Professor George H.
Collier."</p>

<p>In August, 1891, the barometer was carried by
Professor McClure to the summit of Diamond Peak; in
August, 1894, by the writer, to the summit of the middle
peak of the Three Sisters, in Oregon, giving an altitude
of 10,080 feet, not hitherto published; in July, 1895,
Professor McClure took it with the Mazamas to Mount
Adams, and in July, 1897, to the summit of Mount
Rainier.</p>

<p>A new tube was filled and inserted about two years
ago, Professor McClure preparing the mercury by
distillation and the writer boiling it in the tube. The
vacuum was exceptionally perfect. The comparison
sheet previously mentioned showed that the instrument
on the occasion of its last trip read .005 inch above
standard.</p>

<p>In thus completing the labors of Professor McClure,
with whom I was so long and so intimately associated,
I feel a very melancholy satisfaction. For his sake, I
have spared no pains in collecting all the useful data
that could be obtained, to make the result reliable to
the last degree possible in such a case. I leave that
result as a sufficient guarantee of the accuracy of the
whole work from beginning to end.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> PROFESSOR HENRY LANDES</small></h2>

<blockquote><p class="hang">Henry Landes is Professor of Geology and Dean of the College
of Science, University of Washington, and he has also served
as State Geologist of Washington, since 1895. He was born
at Carroll, Indiana, on December 22, 1867. He graduated
from the University of Indiana in 1892 and obtained the Master
of Arts degree at Harvard University in 1893. He was assistant
to the State Geologist of New Jersey and Principal of
the High School at Rockland, Maine, before being elected to
his present professorship at the University of Washington in
1895. For a year and a half, 1914-1915, he was Acting President
of the University of Washington.</p>

<p class="hang">He has published many articles and pamphlets on geological subjects.
The one here given appeared in Mazama, published in
December, 1905, by the Mazamas in Portland, Oregon. It is

<p>The Columbia River afforded to the first people who
came to Washington and Oregon the easiest and most
feasible route across the Cascade Mountains. It was
through this gateway that travel passed from one side
of the range to the other until the advent of the railways
in comparatively recent years. The early travelers
along the river who were of an observing or scientific
bent, noted that the rocks were, in general, dark,
heavy and massive and of the class commonly known as
basalt. Here and there a sort of pudding stone or
agglomerate was observed, which in some instances
might represent a sedimentary deposit, but which here
had clearly an igneous origin.</p>

<p>The observations of the early travelers were supplemented
later by the further studies of geologists; and
from the facts noted along the Columbia River, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
generalization holds good to a great extent on the
Oregon side, but it is by no means true on the Washington
side, as has been shown by later studies.
Granite rocks are encountered within a few miles of
the Columbia River as one travels north along the
Cascade Range. Associated with these granite rocks
are found rocks of a metamorphic type, such as gneiss,
schists, quartzites, crystalline limestone, slate, etc.
Such rocks exist south of Mount Rainier, but are not
conspicuous. North of this point, however, and
throughout all of the northern Cascades they form the
great bulk of the rock.</p>

<p>In other words, in the Cascades of Washington,
igneous activity has been much more common in the
region south of Rainier than in that north of the mountain.
When the first observations were made upon the
great lava flows of southeastern Washington, which
form a part of the greatest lava plain in the world, it
was supposed that the lava had its origin in the volcanoes
of the Cascades. Later investigations have
shown this view to be erroneous. The lava of the plain
has come directly from below through great longitudinal
fissures instead of through circular openings such as
one finds in volcanoes.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Cascades, like most other
mountains, have had several different periods of uplift.
We have several notable examples of mountains
which have had an initial uplift and then have been
reduced to base by erosion. By a second upheaval the
plain has been converted into a plateau, and this in
time assumes a very rugged, mountainous character
as a result of the combined forces of air and water.
Eventually these same forces would reduce the region
to a plain again. Just how many times this thing
has happened in the Cascades we do not know. Bailey
Willis has shown that in the northern Cascades, at
least, the whole country was reduced to a plain prior
to the last uplift, which took place in comparatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
recent times. Out of this plateau, formed by the uplifting
of the plain, has arisen through the active attack
of erosive forces the truly mountainous character of
the district. Erosion has been at the maximum in the
mountains because of the heavy precipitation. Precipitation
in the high mountains being chiefly in the
form of snow has led to the formation of glaciers,
producing thereby a rapidity of erosion of the first
order. The active work of ice and running water has
given to the mountains an extremely rugged appearance,
characterized by valleys of great depth extending
into the very heart of the mountains and with precipitous
divides.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the time consumed in
the uplifting of the Cascades, and the conversion from
plain to plateau, was of considerable duration. With
the beginning of the uplift, the sluggish streams of the
plain became rejuvenated, and took up actively once
more the work of erosion. By the time the maximum
uplift was reached, the plateau had lost to a certain
degree its character of extreme levelness. The streams
had already entrenched themselves in rather conspicuous
valleys. It is believed that the great volcanoes
of Washington&mdash;Rainier and its associates&mdash;began
their activities about the time the uplift described
above reached its maximum height. In the vicinity
of Rainier the rock of the old plateau is granite; and
the volcano may be said to be built upon a platform
of that material. On the north side of the mountain
granite appears conspicuously at a height of about 7,000
feet; while on the south side it appears at points varying
from 5,000 to 6,000 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>That the surface of the granite platform was irregular
and uneven may be seen in the walls of the Nisqually
canyon, near the lower terminus of the glacier. As one
ascends the canyon to the glacier, the contact between
the lava rock and the granite shows quite plainly on
both the right and the left side. On the left the contact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
is at least 1,000 feet above that on the right side. A
little way above the lower end of the glacier, on each
side of the canyon, a good opportunity presents itself
to study the contact of the lava and granite. The
granite at this place shows clearly that it was once a
land surface; and one may note weathering for a
distance downward of seventy-five or one hundred
feet. The upper portion of the granite shows the usual
characteristics of weathering, namely, the conversion
of feldspar into kaolin, the oxidation of iron, etc. At
this point the lava overlying the granite is quite basic
and massive. The first flow reached a thickness here
of fully three hundred feet, and exhibits a fine development
of basaltic structure.</p>

<p>In following up the canyon walls one observes that
the activity of the volcano for some time was characterized
almost exclusively by lava flows. In the
main the lava is an andesite, and is very generally of a
porphyritic structure. Some of the lava flows were of
great extent, and reached points many miles distant
from the center of the mountain. While the earlier
stages of the activity of the volcano were characterized
by lava flows of great thickness, by and by explosive
products began to appear, and interbedded with the
sheets of lava one finds bombs, lapilli, cinders, etc.</p>

<p>It may be said in general that as the volcano grew in
years it changed more and more from eruptions of the
quiet type to those of the explosive character. It is
plain that a long period of time was consumed in the
making of that great volcanic pile, and that the eruptions
were by no means continuous. It is clearly shown
that after certain outflows of lava, quietude reigned for
a time; that at last the surface of the rock became cool
and that erosive agents broke it up into great masses of
loose stones. In later flows of lava these stones were
picked up and cemented into layers of pudding stone,
which are styled agglomerates.</p>

<p>Rocks of an agglomerate type are well shown in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
walls of Gibraltar. This massive pile is largely made
up of boulders, great and small, rather loosely held together
by a lava cement. The work of frost and ice,
expansion and contraction, loosens the boulders readily,
and their constant falling from the cliffs gives to this
part of the mountain's ascent its dangerous character.
While this volcano belongs to a very late period in the
history of the earth, it is very clear that there has been
no marked activity for many thousands of years. The
presence of steam, which is emitted from the hundreds
of small openings about the crater, undoubtedly shows
the presence of heated rock at no great distance below
the surface. Rock is a poor conductor, however, and
cooling takes place with very great slowness after a
depth of comparatively few feet is reached.</p>

<p>Like most volcanoes, the composite character of the
cone is shown on Mount Rainier. After a certain
height is reached in the building up of a cone, the rising
lava in the throat, or the explosive activities within,
sometimes produce an opening through the walls of
the cone, and a new outlet to the surface is formed.
This often gives the volcano a sort of hummocky or
warty appearance, and produces a departure from the
symmetrical character. In the case of Rainier it seems
to the writer that upon the summit four distinct craters,
or outlets, are distinguishable. The first crater reached
by the usual route of ascent is the largest one, and may
be styled the East crater. It is nearly circular in
outline, with a diameter of about one-half mile. Its
walls are bare of snow for nearly the whole of its circumference,
but the pit is filled with snow and ice.
Going across the crater to the westward, one passes
over what is really the highest point on the mountain,
and then goes down into a smaller crater, or the West
crater. This is similar in character and outline to its
neighbor, but here the many jets of issuing steam are
much more prominent. At a point a few hundred
feet lower on the mountain-side there is a peak known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
as Liberty Cap. A cross-section of the cap is in plain
view and shows very clearly that this is a minor cone
or local point of eruption. It is made up of rock very
similar to the main mass of the mountain; and it is
likely that the volcanic activity of the mountain was
centered here for some time. Looking directly south
from the West crater one sees at a distance of less than
a mile another peak which is entirely snow-covered;
but which may represent an instance parallel with
that of the peak on the north side.</p>

<p>Mount Rainier is so deeply covered with ice and snow
that the glacial aspects of the mountain are far more
conspicuous than the volcanic ones. The facts about
the vulcanism and the history of the growth of the
mountain are very difficult to study; and it will be
a long time before they are fully known. The glaciers,
on the other hand, are very conspicuous, comparatively
easy of access, and the many facts concerning their
extent, rate of motion, recession, or advance, may be
quite readily determined. The glaciers, while very
prominent at the present time, were at one time much
larger than now. There are many things which go to
prove that they formerly reached much farther down
the valleys.</p>

<p>From the top of the mountain one may see off to
the westward for many miles south of Puget Sound
prairies of large size, covering a great many square
miles. These prairies represent the plains of gravel
derived from the melting glaciers, when these stood
in their vicinity. From these points of maximum
extension the glaciers have slowly receded to their
present position.</p>

<p>That the glaciers are receding at the present time is
a matter of common observation. At the lower end of
the Nisqually glacier the advancing line of vegetation
is about one-fourth mile below the present limit of the
ice. It is the opinion of Mr. Longmire that the glacier
has retreated about that far since he first came to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
valley, twenty-five years ago. General Stevens was
able to point out several instances of notable shrinkages
in the glaciers, especially in the Paradise glacier, since
his ascent of the mountain in 1870. It will interest
students of glaciers to know that some permanent
monuments have been set up at the lower end of the
Nisqually glacier; and that arrangements have been
made whereby the retreat of the ice may be accurately
measured from year to year.</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang">François Émile Matthes was born at Amsterdam, Holland, on
March 16, 1874. After pursuing studies in Holland, Switzerland
and Germany, he came to the United States in 1891 and
graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1895. Since 1896 he has been at work with the United States
Geological Survey, mostly in the field of topography. He has
been honored by and is a member of many scientific societies.</p>

<p class="hang">His topographic work on the maps of Yosemite and Mount Rainier
National Parks made for him many appreciative friends on the
Pacific Coast. His pamphlet on "Mount Rainier and Its

<p>The impression still prevails in many quarters that
true glaciers, such as are found in the Swiss Alps, do
not exist within the confines of the United States, and
that to behold one of these rare scenic features one
must go to Switzerland, or else to the less accessible
Canadian Rockies or the inhospitable Alaskan coast.
As a matter of fact, permanent bodies of snow and
ice, large enough to deserve the name of glaciers, occur
on many of our western mountain chains, notably in
the Rocky Mountains, where only recently a national
reservation&mdash;Glacier National Park&mdash;was named for
its ice fields; in the Sierra Nevada of California, and
farther north, in the Cascade Range. It is on the
last-named mountain chain that glaciers especially
abound, clustering as a rule in groups about the higher
summits of the crest. But this range also supports
a series of huge, extinct volcanoes that tower high
above its sky line in the form of isolated cones. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
these the snows lie deepest and the glaciers reach
their grandest development. Ice clad from head to
foot the year round, these giant peaks have become
known the country over as the noblest landmarks of
the Pacific Northwest. Foremost among them are
Mount Shasta, in California (14,162 feet); Mount
Hood, in Oregon (11,225 feet); Mount St. Helens
(9,697 feet), Mount Adams (12,307 feet), Mount Rainier
(14,408 feet), and Mount Baker (10,730 feet), in the
State of Washington.</p>

<p>Easily king of all is Mount Rainier. Almost 250
feet higher than Mount Shasta, its nearest rival in
grandeur and in mass, it is overwhelmingly impressive,
both by the vastness of its glacial mantle and by
the striking sculpture of its cliffs. The total area of
its glaciers amounts to no less than 45 square miles,
an expanse of ice far exceeding that of any other single
peak in the United States. Many of its individual
ice streams are between 4 and 6 miles long and vie
in magnitude and in splendor with the most boasted
glaciers of the Alps. Cascading from the summit in
all directions, they radiate like the arms of a great
starfish. All reach down to the foot of the mountain
and some advance considerably beyond.</p>

<p>As for the plea that these glaciers lie in a scarcely
opened, out-of-the-way region, a forbidding wilderness
as compared with maturely civilized Switzerland, it no
longer has the force it once possessed. Rainier's ice
fields can now be reached from Seattle or Tacoma, the
two principal cities of western Washington, in a comfortable
day's journeying, either by rail or by automobile.
The cooling sight of crevassed glaciers and
the exhilarating flower-scented air of alpine meadows
need no longer be exclusive pleasures, to be gained
only by a trip abroad.</p>

<p>Mount Rainier stands on the west edge of the Cascade
Range, overlooking the lowlands that stretch to
Puget Sound. Seen from Seattle or Tacoma, 60 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
50 miles distant, respectively, it appears to rise directly
from sea level, so insignificant seem the ridges about
its base. Yet these ridges themselves are of no mean
height. They rise 3,000 to 4,000 feet above the valleys
that cut through them, and their crests average
6,000 feet in altitude. Thus at the southwest entrance
of the park, in the Nisqually Valley, the elevation
above sea level, as determined by accurate spirit
leveling, is 2,003 feet, while Mount Wow (Goat Mountain),
immediately to the north, rises to an altitude
of 6,045 feet. But so colossal are the proportions of
the great volcano that they dwarf even mountains of
this size and give them the appearance of mere foothills.
In the Tatoosh Range Pinnacle Peak is one
of the higher summits, 6,562 feet in altitude. That
peak rises nearly 4,000 feet above the Nisqually
River, which at Longmire has an elevation of 2,700
feet, yet it will be seen that Mount Rainier towers
still 7,846 feet higher than Pinnacle Peak.</p>

<p>From the top of the volcano one fairly looks down
upon the Tatoosh Range, to the south; upon Mount
Wow, to the southwest; upon the Mother Mountains,
to the northwest, indeed, upon all the ridges of the
Cascade Range. Only Mount Adams, Mount St.
Helens, and Mount Hood loom like solitary peaks
above the even sky line, while the ridges below this
line seem to melt together in one vast, continuous
mountain platform. And such a platform, indeed,
one should conceive the Cascade Range once to have
been. Only it is now thoroughly dissected by profound,
ramifying valleys, and has been resolved into
a sea of wavelike crests and peaks.</p>

<p>Mount Rainier stands, in round numbers, 10,000
feet high above its immediate base, and covers 100
square miles of territory, or one-third of the area of
Mount Rainier National Park. In shape it is not a
simple cone tapering to a slender, pointed summit
like Fuji Yama, the great volcano of Japan. It is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
rather, a broadly truncated mass resembling an enormous
tree stump with spreading base and irregularly
broken top. Its life history has been a varied one.
Like all volcanoes, Rainier has built up its cone with
the material ejected by its own eruptions&mdash;with
cinders and bombs (steam-shredded particles and
lumps of lava), and with occasional flows of liquid
lava that have solidified into layers of hard, basaltic
rock. At one time it attained an altitude of not less
than 16,000 feet, if one may judge by the steep inclination
of the lava and cinder layers visible in its
flanks. Then a great explosion followed that destroyed
the top part of the mountain, and reduced its height
by some 2,000 feet. The volcano was left beheaded,
and with a capacious hollow crater, surrounded by
a jagged rim.</p>

<p>Later on this great cavity, which measured nearly
3 miles across, from south to north, was filled by two
small cinder cones. Successive feeble eruptions added
to their height until at last they formed together a
low, rounded dome&mdash;the eminence that now constitutes
the mountain's summit. It rises only about
400 feet above the rim of the old crater, and is an inconspicuous
feature, not readily identifiable from all
sides as the highest point. In fact, so broad is the
mountain's crown that from no point at its base can
one see the top. The higher portions of the old crater
rim, moreover, rise to elevations within a few hundred
feet of the summit, and, especially when viewed from
below, stand out boldly as separate peaks that mask
and seem to overshadow the central dome. Especially
prominent are Peak Success (14,150 feet) on the
southwest side, and Liberty Cap (14,112 feet) on the
northwest side.</p>

<p>The altitude of the main summit has for many years
been in doubt. Several figures have been announced
from time to time, no two of them in agreement with
each other; but all of these, it is to be observed, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
obtained by more or less approximate methods. In
1913 the United States Geological Survey, in connection
with its topographic surveys of the Mount
Rainier National Park, was able to make a new series
of measurements by triangulation methods at close
range. These give the peak an elevation of 14,408
feet, thus placing it near the top of the list of high
summits of the United States. This last figure, it
should be added, is not likely to be in error by more
than a foot or two and may with some confidence be
regarded as final. Greater exactness of determination
is scarcely practicable in the case of Mount Rainier,
as its highest summit consists actually of a mound of
snow the height of which naturally varies somewhat
with the seasons and from year to year.</p>

<p>This crowning snow mound, which was once supposed
to be the highest point in the United States, still
bears the proud name of Columbia Crest. It is essentially
a huge snowdrift or snow dune, heaped up
by the westerly winds. Driving furiously up through
the great breach in the west flank of the mountain,
between Peak Success and Liberty Cap, they eddy
lightly as they shoot over the summit and there deposit
their load of snow.</p>

<p>The drift is situated at the point where the rims of
the two summit craters touch, and represents the only
permanent snow mass on these rims, for some of the
internal heat of the volcano still remains and suffices
to keep these rock-crowned curving ridges bare of snow
the better part of the year. It is intense enough, even,
to produce numerous steam jets along the inner face
of the rim of the east crater, which appears to be the
most recently formed of the two. The center of this
depression, however, is filled with snow, so that it has
the appearance of a shallow, white-floored bowl some
1,200 feet in diameter. Great caverns are melted out
by the steam jets under the edges of the snow mass,
and these caverns afford shelters which, though uninviting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
are not to be despised. They have proved a
blessing to more than one party that has found itself
compelled to remain overnight on the summit, saving
them from death in the icy gales.</p>

<p>That Mount Rainier should still retain so much of
its internal heat is not surprising in view of the recency
of its eruptions. It is known to have been active at
intervals during the last century, and actual record
exists of slight eruptions in 1843, 1854, 1858, and 1870.
Indian legends mention a great cataclysmal outburst
at an earlier period.</p>

<p>At present the volcano may be regarded as dormant
and no apprehension need be felt as to the possibility
of an early renewal of its activity. The steam jets in
the summit crater, it is true, as well as the hot springs
at the mountain's foot (Longmire Springs), attest the
continued presence of subterranean fires, but they are
only feeble evidences as compared with the geysers,
the steam jets, and the hot springs of the Yellowstone
National Park. Yet that region is not considered any
less safe to visit because of the presence of these thermal
phenomena.</p>

<p>In spite of Mount Rainier's continued activity until
within the memory of man its sides appear to have
been snow clad for a considerable length of time.
Indeed, so intense and so long-continued has been the
eroding action of the ice that the cone is now deeply
ice-scarred and furrowed. Most of its outer layers,
in fact, appear already to have been stripped away.
Here and there portions of them remain standing on
the mountain's flanks in the form of sharp-crested
crags and ridges, and from these one may roughly
surmise the original dimensions of the cone. Mere
details in the volcano's sculpture, these residual masses
are, some of them, so tall that, were they standing
among ordinary mountains, they would be reckoned
as great peaks. Particularly noteworthy is Little
Tahoma, a sharp, triangular tooth on the east flank,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that rises to an elevation of 11,117 feet. In its steep,
ice-carved walls one may trace ascending volcanic
strata aggregating 2,000 feet in thickness that point
upward to the place of their origin, the former summit
of the mountain, which rose almost half a mile
higher than the present top.</p>

<p>Nor is the great crater rim left by the explosion
that carried off the original summit preserved in its
entirety. Peak Success and Liberty Cap are the only
two promontories that give trustworthy indication of
its former height and strength. Probably they represent
the more massive portions on the southwest and
northwest sides, respectively, while the weaker portions
to the east and south have long since crumbled
away under the heavy ice cascades that have been overriding
them for ages. Only a few small rocky points
remain upon which the snows split in their descent.
The most prominent, as well as the most interesting,
is the one on the southeast side, popularly known as
Gibraltar Rock. Really a narrow, wedge-shaped mass,
it appears in profile like a massive, square-cut promontory.
The trail to the summit of the mountain passes
along its overhanging south face and then ascends by
a precipitous chute between ice and rock. It is this
part of the ascent that is reputed as the most precarious
and hazardous.</p>

<p>From the rim points downward the ice cover of the
cone divides into a number of distinct stream-like
tongues or glaciers, each sunk in a great hollow pathway
of its own. Between these ice-worn trenches
the uneroded portions of the cone stand out in high
relief, forming as a rule huge triangular "wedges,"
heading at the sharp rim points and spreading thence
downward to the mountain's base. There they assume
the aspect of more gently sloping, grassy table-lands,
the charming alpine meadows of which Paradise
Park and Spray Park are the most famous. Separating
these upland parks are the profound ice-cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
canyons which, beyond the glacier ends, widen out into
densely forested valleys, each containing a swift-flowing
river. No less than a dozen of these ice-fed
torrents radiate from the volcano in all directions,
while numerous lesser streams course from the snow
fields between the glaciers.</p>

<p>Thus the cone of Mount Rainier is seen to be dissected
from its summit to its foot. Sculptured by its
own glacier mantle, its slopes have become diversified
with a fretwork of ridges, peaks, and canyons.</p>

<p>The first ice one meets on approaching the mountain
from Longmire Springs lies in the upper end of
the Nisqually Valley. The wagon road, which up to
this point follows the west side of the valley, winding
in loops and curves along the heavily wooded mountain
flank, here ventures out upon the rough bowlder
bed of the Nisqually River and crosses the foaming
torrent on a picturesque wooden bridge. A scant
thousand feet above this structure, blocking the valley
to a height of some 400 feet, looms a huge shapeless
pile of what seems at first sight only rock débris, gray
and chocolate in color. It is the dirt-stained end of
one of the largest glaciers&mdash;the Nisqually. From a
yawning cave in its front issues the Nisqually stream,
a river full fledged from the start.</p>

<p>The altitude here, it should be noted, is a trifle under
4,000 feet (elevation of bridge is 3,960 feet); hence
the ice in view lies more than 10,000 feet below the
summit of the mountain, the place of its origin. And
in this statement is strikingly summed up the whole
nature and economy of a glacier such as the Nisqually.</p>

<p>A glacier is not a mere stationary blanket of snow
and ice clinging inert to the mountain flank. It is a
slowly moving streamlike body that descends by virtue
of its own weight. The upper parts are continually
being replenished by fresh snowfalls, which at those
high altitudes do not entirely melt away in summer;
while the lower end, projecting as it does below the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
snow line, loses annually more by melting than it receives
by precipitation, and is maintained only by the
continued accession of masses from above. The rate
at which the ice advances has been determined by
Prof. J. N. Le Conte, of the University of California.
In 1903 he placed a row of stakes across the glacier,
and with the aid of surveying instruments obtained accurate
measurements of the distances through which
they moved from day to day. He found that in summer,
when the movement is greatest, it averages 16
inches per day. This figure, however, applies only to
the central portion of the glacier&mdash;the main current,
so to speak&mdash;for the margins necessarily move more
slowly, being retarded by friction against the channel
sides.</p>

<p>The snout of the Nisqually Glacier, accordingly, is
really composed of slowly advancing ice, but so rapid
is the melting at this low altitude that it effectually
counterbalances the advance, and thus the ice front
remains essentially stationary and apparently fixed
in place. Actually, it is subject to slight back and
forward movements, amounting to a foot or more per
day; for, as one may readily imagine, fluctuations in
snowfall and in temperature, above or below the normal,
are ever likely to throw the balance one way or
another.</p>

<p>A glacier may also make periodic advances or retreats
on a larger scale in obedience to climatic changes extending
over many years. Thus all the glaciers on
Mount Rainier, as well as many in other parts of the
world, are at present, and have been for some time,
steadily retreating as the result of milder climate or of
a lessening in snow supply. Only so recently as 1885
the Nisqually Glacier reached down to the place now
occupied by the bridge, and it is safe to say that at
that time no engineer would have had the daring to plan
the road as it is now laid. In the last 25 years, however,
the Nisqually Glacier has retreated fully 1,000 feet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Evidences of similar wholesale recession are to be
observed at the ends of the other glaciers of Mount
Rainier, but the measure of their retreat is not recorded
with the precision that was possible in the case
of the Nisqually Glacier. Eyewitnesses still live at
Longmire Springs who can testify to the former extension
of the Nisqually Glacier down to the site of
the wagon bridge.</p>

<p>As one continues the ascent by the wagon road a
partial view of the glacier's lower course is obtained,
and there is gained some idea of its stream-like character.
More satisfying are the views from Paradise
Park. Here several miles of the ice stream (its total
length is nearly 5 miles) lie stretched out at one's
feet, while looking up toward the mountain one beholds
the tributary ice fields and ice streams, pouring, as it
were, from above, from right and left, rent by innumerable
crevasses and resembling foaming cascades
suddenly crystallized in place. The turmoil of these
upper branches may be too confusing to be studied
with profit, but the more placid lower course presents a
favorable field for observation, and a readily accessible
one at that.</p>

<p>A veritable frozen river it seems, flowing between
smooth, parallel banks, half a mile apart. Its surface,
in contrast to the glistening ice cascades above, has the
prevailingly somber tint of old ice, relieved here and
there by bright patches of last winter's snow. These
lie for the most part in gaping fissures or crevasses
that run athwart the glacier at short intervals and
divide its body into narrow slices. In the upper course,
where the glacier overrides obstacles in its bed, the
crevasses are particularly numerous and irregularly
spaced, sometimes occurring in two sets intersecting at
right angles, and producing square-cut prisms. Farther
down the ice stream's current is more sluggish
and the crevasses heal up by degrees, providing a
united surface, over which one may travel freely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Gradually, also, the glacier covers itself with débris.
Angular rock fragments, large and small, and quantities
of dust, derived from the rock walls bordering
the ice stream higher up, litter its surface and hide the
color of the ice. At first only a narrow ridge of such
material&mdash;a moraine, as it is called&mdash;accompanies
the ice river on each side, resembling a sharp-crested
embankment built by human hands to restrain its
floods; but toward the lower end of the glacier, as the
ice wastes away, the débris contained in it is released
in masses, and forms brown marginal bands, fringing
the moraines. In fact, from here on down it becomes
difficult to tell where the ice of the glacier ends at the
sides and where the moraines begin.</p>

<p>The lower part of the glacier also possesses a peculiar
feature in the form of a débris ridge about midway on
its back&mdash;a medial moraine. Most of the way it
stretches like a slender, dark ribbon, gradually narrowing
upstream. One may trace it with the eye up
to its point of origin, the junction of the two main
branches of the glacier, at the foot of a sharp rock spur
on the mountain's flank.</p>

<p>In the last mile of the Nisqually's course, this medial
moraine develops from a mere dirt band to a conspicuous
embankment, projecting 40 feet above the ice. Not
the entire body of the ridge, however, is made up of rock
débris. The feature owes its elevation chiefly to the protective
influence of the débris layer on its surface, which
is thick enough to shield the ice beneath from the hot
rays of the sun, and greatly retards melting, while the
adjoining unprotected ice surfaces are rapidly reduced.</p>

<p>A short distance above the glacier's terminus the
medial moraine and the ever-broadening marginal
bands come together. No more clear ice remains
exposed, irregular mounds and ridges of débris cover
the entire surface of the glacier, and the moraine-smothered
mass assumes the peculiar inchoate appearance
that is so striking upon first view.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>In utter contrast with the glacier's dying lower end
are the bright snow fields on the summit in which it
commences its career. Hard by the rock rim of the
east summit crater the snows begin, enwrapping in an
even, immaculate layer the smooth sides of the cinder
cone. Only a few feet deep at first, they thicken
downward by degrees, until, a thousand feet below the
crater, they possess sufficient depth and weight to
acquire movement. Occasional angular crevasses here
interrupt the slope and force the summit-bound traveler
to make wearying detours.</p>

<p>Looking down into a gash of this sort one beholds
nothing but clean snow, piled in many layers. Only
a faint blue tinges the crevasse walls, darkening but
slowly with the depth, in contrast to the intense indigo
hue characteristic of the partings in the lower course
of the glacier. There the material is a dense ice, more
or less crystalline in texture; here it is scarcely more
than snow, but slightly compacted and loosely granular&mdash;what
is generally designated by the Swiss term
"névé."</p>

<p>For several thousand feet down, as far as the 10,000-foot
level, in fact, does the snow retain this granular
consistency. One reason for the slowness with which
it compacts is found in the low temperatures that prevail
at high altitudes and preclude any considerable
melting. The air itself seldom rises above the freezing
point, even in the middle of the day, and as a consequence
the snow never becomes soft and mushy, as
it does at lower levels.</p>

<p>When snow assumes the mushy, "wet-sugar" state,
it is melting internally as well as at its outer surface,
owing both to the water that soaks into it and to the
warming of the air inclosed within its innumerable
tiny pores (which tiny air spaces, by the way, give the
snow its brilliant whiteness). Snow in this condition
has, paradoxical though it may sound, a temperature
a few tenths of a degree higher than the melting point&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
fact recently established by delicate temperature
measurements made on European glaciers. It is this
singular fact, no doubt, that explains how so many
minute organisms are able to flourish and propagate
in summer on the lower portions of many glaciers. It
may be of interest to digress here briefly in order to
speak of these little known though common forms of life.</p>

<p>Several species of insects are among the regular inhabitants
of glaciers. Most of them belong to a very
low order&mdash;the Springtails, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thysanura</i>&mdash;and are
so minute that in spite of their dark color they escape
the attention of most passers-by. If one looks
closely, however, they may readily be observed hopping
about like miniature fleas or wriggling deftly into
the cavities of the snow. It seems to incommode them
but little if in their acrobatic jumps they occasionally
alight in a puddle or in a rill, for they are thickly clad
with furry scales that prevent them from getting wet&mdash;just
as a duck is kept dry by its greasy feathers.</p>

<p>Especially plentiful on the lower parts of the Rainier
glaciers, and more readily recognized, are slender dark-brown
worms of the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mesenchytraeus</i>, about 1 inch
in length. Millions and millions of them may be seen
on favorable days in July and August writhing on the
surface of the ice, evidently breeding there and feeding
on organic matter blown upon the glacier in the
form of dust. So essential to their existence is the
chill of the ice that they enter several inches, and
sometimes many feet below the surface on days when
the sun is particularly hot, reappearing late in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>Mention also deserves to be made of that microscopic
plant <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Protococcus nivalis</i>, which is responsible for the
mysterious pink or light, rose-colored patches so often
met with on glaciers&mdash;the "red snow" of a former
superstition. Each patch represents a colony or culture
comprising billions of individuals. It is probable
that they represent but a small fraction of the total
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
microflora thriving on the snow, the other species remaining
invisible for lack of a conspicuous color.</p>

<p>To return to the frigid upper névés, it is not to be
supposed that they suffer no loss whatever by melting.
The heat radiated directly to them by the sun
is alone capable of doing considerable damage, even
while the air remains below the freezing point. At
these high altitudes the sun heat is astonishingly intense,
as more than one uninitiated mountain climber
has learned to his sorrow by neglecting to take the
customary precaution of blacking his face before making
the ascent. In a few hours the skin is literally scorched
and begins to blister painfully.</p>

<p>At the foot of the mountain the sun heat is relatively
feeble, for much of it is absorbed by the dust and
vapor in the lower layers of the atmosphere, but on
the summit, which projects 2 miles higher, the air is
thin and pure, and lets the rays pass through but little
diminished in strength.</p>

<p>The manner in which the sun affects the snow is
peculiar and distinctive. Instead of reducing the
surface evenly, it melts out many close-set cups and
hollows, a foot or more in diameter and separated by
sharp spires and crests. No water is visible anywhere,
either in rills or in pools, evaporation keeping
pace with the reduction. If the sun's action is permitted
to continue uninterrupted for many days, as
may happen in a hot, dry summer, these snow cups
deepen by degrees, until at length they assume the
aspect of gigantic bee cells, several feet in depth. Snow
fields thus honeycombed may be met with on the slopes
above Gibraltar Rock. They are wearisome to traverse,
for the ridges and spines are fairly resistant, so
that one must laboriously clamber over them. Most
exasperating, however, is the going after a snowstorm
has filled the honeycombs. Then the traveler, waist
deep in mealy snow, is left to flounder haphazard
through a hidden labyrinth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Of interest in this connection is the great snow cliff
immediately west of Gibraltar Rock. Viewed from
the foot of that promontory, the sky line of the snow
castle fairly bristles with honeycomb spines; while
below, in the face of the snow cliff, dark, wavy lines,
roughly parallel to the upper surface, repeat its pattern
in subdued form. They represent the honeycombs of
previous seasons, now buried under many feet of snow,
but still traceable by the dust that was imprisoned
with them.</p>

<p>The snow cliff west of Gibraltar Rock is of interest
also for other reasons. It is the end of a great snow
cascade that descends from the rim of the old crater.
Several such cascades may be seen on the south side
of the mountain, separated by craggy remnants of the
crater rim. Above them the summit névés stretch in
continuous fields, but from the rim on down, the
volcano's slopes are too precipitous to permit a gradual
descent, and the névés break into wild cascades and
falls. Fully two to three thousand feet they tumble,
assembling again in compact, sluggish ice fields on the
gentler slopes below.</p>

<p>Of the three cascades that feed the Nisqually Glacier
only the central one, it is to be observed, forms a continuous
connection between the summit névés and the
lower ice fields. The two others, viz. the one next to
Gibraltar and the westernmost of the three, terminate
in vertical cliffs, over great precipices of rock. From
them snow masses detach at intervals and produce
thundering avalanches that bound far out over the
inclined ice fields below. Especially frequent are the
falls from the cliff near Gibraltar. They occur hourly
at certain times, but as a rule at periods of one or
more days.</p>

<p>From the westernmost cascade avalanches are small
and rare. Indeed, as one watches them take place at
long intervals throughout a summer one can not but
begin to doubt whether they are in themselves really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
sufficient to feed and maintain so extensive an ice
field as lies stretched out under them. Surely much
more snow must annually melt away from the broad
surface of that field, exposed as it lies to the midday
sun, than the insignificant avalanches can replace.
Were they its only source of supply, the ice field, one
feels confident, would soon cease to exist.</p>

<p>The fact is that the ice field in question is not dependent
for its support on the avalanches from above.
It may receive some contributions to its volume through
them, but in reality it is an independent ice body,
nourished chiefly by direct snow precipitation from the
clouds. And this is true, in large measure, of all the
ice fields lying under the ice cascades. The Nisqually
Glacier, accordingly, is not to be regarded as composed
merely of the cascading névés, reunited and cemented
together, but as taking a fresh start at these lower
levels. Improbable though this may seem at first, it
is nevertheless a fact that is readily explained.</p>

<p>The winter snows on Mount Rainier are heaviest in
the vicinity of its base; indeed, the snowfall at those
low levels is several times greater than that on the
summit. This in itself may seem anomalous. So accustomed
is one to think that the snowfall on high
mountains increases with the altitude that it seems
strange to find a case in which the opposite is true.
Yet Mount Rainier stands by no means alone in this
regard. The Sierra Nevada and the Andes, the
Himalayas and the Alps, all show closely analogous
conditions.</p>

<p>In each of these lofty mountain regions the precipitation
is known to be heaviest at moderate altitudes,
while higher up it decreases markedly. The reason is
that the storm clouds&mdash;the clouds that carry most of
the rain and snow&mdash;hang in a zone of only moderate
elevation, while higher up the atmosphere contains
but little moisture and seldom forms clouds of any
great density.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Rainier region the height of the storm clouds
is in large measure regulated by the relief of the Cascade
Range; for it is really this cooling mountain barrier
that compels the moisture-laden winds from the
Pacific Ocean to condense and to discharge. It follows
that the storm clouds are seldom much elevated
above the sky line of the Cascade Mountains; they
cling, so to speak, to its crest and ridges, while the cone
of Mount Rainier towers high above them into serener
skies. Many a day may one look down from the summit,
or even from a halfway point, such as Camp
Muir (10,062 feet), upon the upper surface of the
clouds. Like a layer of fleecy cotton they appear,
smothering the lower mountains and enveloping the
volcano's base.</p>

<p>Clouds, it is true, are frequently seen gathering about
the mountain's crown, usually in the form of a circular
cap or hood, precursor of a general storm, but such
clouds yield but very little snow.</p>

<p>No accurate measurements have been made of the
snowfall at the mountain's foot, but in the Nisqually
Valley, at Longmire Springs, the winter snows are
known often to exceed 20 feet in depth. The summer
heat at this low level (2,762 feet) is, of course, abundantly
able to remove all of it, at least by the end of
May. But higher up every thousand feet of elevation
suffices to prolong appreciably the life of the snowy
cover. In Paradise Park, for instance, at altitudes
between 5,000 and 6,000 feet, huge snowdrifts encumber
the flowering meadows until far into July. Above
an altitude of 6,000 feet permanent drifts and snow
fields survive in certain favored spots, while at the
7,000-foot level the snow line, properly speaking, is
reached. Above this line considerable snow remains
regularly from one winter to the next, and extensive
ice fields and glaciers exist even without protection
from the sun.</p>

<p>It is between the 8,000 and 10,000 foot levels, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that one meets with the conditions most favorable
for the development of glaciers. Below this zone
the summer heat largely offsets the heavy precipitation,
while above it the snowfall itself is relatively
scant. Within the belt the annual addition of snow
to the ice fields is greater than anywhere else on Mount
Rainier. The result is manifest in the arrangement
and distribution of the glaciers on the cone. By far
the greater number originate in the vicinity of the
10,000-foot level, while those ice streams which cascade
from the summit, such as the Nisqually, are in
a sense reborn some 4,000 feet lower down.</p>

<p>A striking example of an ice body nourished wholly
by the snows falling on the lower slope of Mount
Rainier is the Paradise Glacier. In no wise connected
with the summit névés, it makes its start at an elevation
of less than 9,000 feet. Situated on the spreading
slope between the diverging canyons of the Nisqually
on the west and of the Cowlitz on the northeast, it
constitutes a typical "interglacier," as intermediate
ice bodies of this kind are termed.</p>

<p>Its appearance is that of a gently undulating ice
field, crevassed only toward its lower edge and remarkably
clean throughout. No débris-shedding cliffs
rise anywhere along its borders, and this fact, no doubt,
largely explains its freedom from morainal accumulations.</p>

<p>The absence of cliffs also implies a lack of protecting
shade. Practically the entire expanse of the glacier
lies exposed to the full glare of the sun. As a consequence
its losses by melting are very heavy, and a
single hot summer may visibly diminish the glacier's
bulk. Nevertheless it seems to hold its own as well
as any other glacier on Mount Rainier, and this ability
to recuperate finds its explanation in the exceeding
abundance of fresh snows that replenish it every winter.</p>

<p>The Paradise Glacier, however, is not the product
wholly of direct precipitation from the clouds. Much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of its mass is supplied by the wind, and accumulates
in the lee of the high ridge to the west, over which the
route to Camp Muir and Gibraltar Rock is laid. The
westerly gales keep this ridge almost bare of snow,
permitting only a few drifts to lodge in sheltered depressions.
But east of the ridge there are great eddies
in which the snow forms long, smooth slopes that descend
several hundred feet to the main body of the
glacier. These slopes are particularly inviting to tourists
for the delightful "glissades" which they afford.
Sitting down on the hard snow at the head of such a
slope, one may indulge in an exhilarating glide of amazing
swiftness, landing at last safely on the level snows
beneath.</p>

<p>The generally smooth and united surface of the
Paradise Glacier, it may be added, contributes not
a little to its attractiveness as a field for alpine sports.
On it one may roam at will without apprehension of
lurking peril; indeed one can journey across its entire
width, from Paradise Park to the Cowlitz Rocks,
without encountering a single dangerous fissure. This
general absence of crevasses is accounted for largely
by the evenness of the glacier's bed and by its hollow
shape, owing to which the snows on all sides press
inward and compact the mass in the center. Only
toward its frontal margin, where the glacier plunges
over an abrupt rock step, as well as in the hump of that
part known as Stevens Glacier, is the ice rent by long
crevasses and broken into narrow blades. Here it
may be wise for the inexperienced not to venture without
a competent guide, for the footing is apt to be
treacherous, and jumping over crevasses or crossing
them by frail snow bridges are feats never accomplished
without risk.</p>

<p>In the early part of summer the Paradise Glacier
has the appearance of a vast, unbroken snow field,
blazing, immaculate, in the sun. But later, as the
fresh snows melt away from its surface, grayish patches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of old crystalline ice develop in places, more especially
toward the glacier's lower margin. Day by day these
patches expand until, by the end of August, most of
the lower ice field has been stripped of its brilliant
mantle. Its countenance, once bright and serene, now
assumes a grim expression and becomes crisscrossed by
a thousand seams, like the visage of an aged man.</p>

<p>Over this roughened surface trickle countless tiny
rills which, uniting, form swift rivulets and torrents,
indeed veritable river systems on a miniature scale
that testify with eloquence to the rapidity with which
the sun consumes the snow. Strangely capricious in
course are these streamlets, for, while in the main
gravitating with the glacier's slope, they are ever likely
to be caught and deflected by the numerous seams in
the ice. These seams, it should be explained, are lines
of former crevasses that have healed again under pressure
in the course of the glacier's slow descent. As a
rule they inclose a small amount of dirt, and owing
to its presence are particularly vulnerable to erosion.
Along them the streamlets rapidly intrench themselves&mdash;perhaps
by virtue of their warmth, what little there
is of it, as much as by actual abrasion&mdash;and hollow
out channels of a freakish sort, here straight and
canal-like, there making sharp zigzag turns; again
broadening into profound, canoe-shaped pools, or
emptying into deeper trenches by little sparkling cataracts,
or passing under tiny bridges and tunnels&mdash;a
veritable toy land carved in ice.</p>

<p>But unfortunately these pretty features are ephemeral,
many of them changing from day to day; for,
evenings, as the lowering sun withdraws its heat,
the melting gradually comes to a halt, and the little
streams cease to flow. The soft babbling and gurgling
and the often exquisitely melodious tinkle of dripping
water in hidden glacial wells are hushed, and the silent
frost proceeds to choke up passages and channels, so
that next day's waters have to seek new avenues.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>In the region where the new crevasses open the surface
drainage comes abruptly to an end. Here gaping
chutes of deepest azure entrap the torrents and the
waters rush with musical thunder to the interior of
the glacier and finally down to its bed.</p>

<p>At its lower border the Paradise Glacier splits into
several lobes. The westernmost sends forth the Paradise
River, which, turning southwestward, plunges
over the Sluiskin Fall (named for the Klickitat Indian
who guided Van Trump and Hazard Stevens to the
mountain in 1870, when they made the first successful
ascent) and runs the length of Paradise Valley.
The middle lobe has become known as Stevens Glacier
(named for Hazard Stevens) and ends in Stevens Creek,
a stream which almost immediately drops over a precipice
of some 600 feet&mdash;the Fairy Falls&mdash;and winds
southeastward through rugged Stevens Canyon. The
easternmost lobes, known collectively as Williwakas
Glacier, send forth two little cascades, which, uniting,
form Williwakas Creek. This stream is a tributary of
the Cowlitz River, as is Stevens Creek.</p>

<p>Immediately adjoining the Paradise Glacier on the
northeast, and not separated from it by any definite
barrier, lies the Cowlitz Glacier, one of the stateliest
ice streams of Mount Rainier. It flows in a southeasterly
direction, and burrows its nose deeply into the
forest-covered hills at the mountain's foot. Its upper
course consists of two parallel-flowing ice streams, intrenched
in profound troughs, which they have enlarged
laterally until now only a narrow, ragged crest
of rock remains between them, resembling a partition
a thousand feet in height. At the upper end of this
crest stands Gibraltar Rock.</p>

<p>At the point of confluence of the two branches there
begins a long medial moraine that stretches like a
black tape the whole length of the lower course. To
judge by its position midway on the glacier's back, the
two tributaries must be very nearly equal in strength,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
yet, when traced to their sources, they are found to
originate in widely different ways. The north branch,
named Ingraham Glacier (after Maj. E. S. Ingraham,
one of Rainier's foremost pioneers), comes from the
névés on the summit; while the south branch heads in
a pocket immediately under Gibraltar. No snow
comes to it from the summit; hence we can not escape
the conclusion that it receives through direct precipitation
and through wind drifting about as much snow as
its sister branch receives from the summit regions.
Like the glacier troughs below, the pocket appears to
have widened laterally under the influence of the ice,
and is now separated from the Nisqually ice fields to
the west by only a narrow rock partition, the Cowlitz
Cleaver, as it is locally called. Up this narrow crest
the route to Gibraltar Rock ascends. The name
"cleaver," it may be said in passing, is most apt for
the designation of a narrow rock crest of this sort, and
well deserves to be more generally used in the place of
awkward foreign terms, such as arrete and grat.</p>

<p>Both branches of the Cowlitz Glacier cascade steeply
immediately above their confluence, but the lower glacier
has a gentle gradient and a fairly uneventful course.
Like the lower Nisqually, it is bordered by long morainal
ridges, and toward its end acquires broad marginal dirt
bands. For nearly a mile these continue, leaving a
gradually narrowing lane of clear ice between them.
Then they coalesce and the whole ice body becomes
strewn with rock débris.</p>

<p>The Cowlitz Glacier, including its north branch, the
Ingraham Glacier, measures slightly over 6 miles in
length. Throughout that distance the ice stream lies
sunk in a steep-walled canyon of its own carving. Imposing
cliffs of columnar basalt, ribbed as if draped in
corduroy, overlook its lower course. Slender waterfalls
glide down their precipitous fronts, like silver
threads, guided by the basalt flutings.</p>

<p>From the end of the glacier issues the Muddy Fork
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of the Cowlitz River, which, joining the Ohanapecosh,
forms the Cowlitz River proper, one of the largest
streams of the Cascade Range. For nearly a hundred
miles the Cowlitz River follows a southwesterly course,
finally emptying in the Columbia River a short distance
below Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p>The name Muddy Fork is a most apt one, for the
stream leaves the glacier heavily charged with débris
and mud, and while it gradually clears itself as it
proceeds over its gravelly bed, it is still turbid when
it reaches the Ohanapecosh. That stream is relatively
clear, for it heads in a glacier of small extent and little
eroding power, and consequently begins its career
with but a moderate load; furthermore it receives on
its long circuitous course a number of tributaries from
the Cascade Range, all of them containing clear water.</p>

<p>The name Muddy, however, might with equal appropriateness
be given to every one of the streams
flowing from the ice fields of Mount Rainier. So easily
disintegrated are the volcanic materials of which that
peak is composed, that the glaciers are enabled to erode
with great rapidity, even in their present shrunken
state. They consequently deliver to the streams vast
quantities of débris, much of it in the form of cobbles
and bowlders, but much of it also in the form of "rock
flour."</p>

<p>A considerable proportion of a glacier's erosional
work is performed by abrasion or grinding, its bed
being scoured and grooved by the rock blocks and
smaller débris held by the passing ice. As a result
glacier streams ordinarily carry much finely comminuted
rock, or rock flour, and this, because of its
fineness, remains long in suspension and imparts to
the water a distinctive color. In regions of light-colored
rocks the glacier streams have a characteristic
milky hue, which, as it fades out, passes over into a
delicate turquoise tint. But the lavas of Mount
Rainier produce for the most part dark-hued flour, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
as a consequence the rivers coming from that peak are
dyed a somber chocolate brown.</p>

<p>A word may not be out of place here about the sharp
daily fluctuations of the ice-fed rivers of the Mount
Rainier National Park, especially in view of the difficulties
these streams present to crossing. There are
fully a score of turbulent rivers radiating from the
peak, and as a consequence one can not journey far
through the park without being obliged to cross one
of them. On all the permanent trails substantial
bridges obviate the difficulty, but in the less developed
portions of the park, fording is still the only method
available. It is well to bear in mind that these rivers,
being nourished by melting snow, differ greatly in habit
from streams in countries where glaciers are absent.
Generally speaking, they are highest in summer and
lowest in winter; also, since their flow is intimately
dependent upon the quantity of snow being melted at
a given time, it follows that in summer when the sun
reaches its greatest power they swell daily to a prodigious
volume, reaching a maximum in the afternoon,
while during the night and early morning hours they
again ebb to a relatively moderate size. In the forenoon
of a warm summer day one may watch them grow
hourly in volume and in violence, until toward the
middle of the day they become raging torrents of liquid
mud in which heavy cobbles and even bowlders may
be heard booming as they roll before the current. It
would be nothing short of folly to attempt to ford under
these conditions, whether on horseback or on foot. In
the evening, however, and still better, in the early
morning, one may cross with safety; the streams then
have the appearance of mere mountain brooks wandering
harmlessly over broad bowlder beds.</p>

<p>High above the Ingraham Glacier towers that sharp,
residual mass of lava strata known as Little Tahoma
(11,117 feet), the highest outstanding eminence on the
flank of Mount Rainier. It forms a gigantic "wedge"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
that divides the Ingraham from the Emmons Glacier
to the north. So extensive is this wedge that it carries
on its back several large ice fields and interglaciers,
some of which, lying far from the beaten path of the
tourist, are as yet unnamed. Separating them from
each other are various attenuated, pinnacled crests, all
of them subordinate to a main backbone that runs
eastward some 6 miles and terminates in the Cowlitz
Chimneys (7,607 feet), a group of tall rock towers
that dominate the landscape on the east side of Mount
Rainier.</p>

<p>Most of the ice fields, naturally, lie on the shady
north slope of the main backbone; in fact, a series of
them extends as far east as the Cowlitz Chimneys. One
of the lesser crests, however, that running southeastward
to the upland region known as Cowlitz Park, also
gives protection to an ice body of some magnitude, the
Ohanapecosh Glacier. Considerably broader than it
is long in the direction of its flow, this glacier lies on a
high shelf a mile and a half across, whence it cascades
down into the head of a walled-in canyon. Formerly,
no doubt, it more than filled this canyon, but now it
sends down only a shrunken lobe. The stream that
issues from it, the Ohanapecosh River, is really the
main prong and head of the Cowlitz River.</p>

<p>The largest and most elevated of the ice fields east
of Little Tahoma is known for its peculiar shape as
Fryingpan Glacier. It covers fully 3 square miles of
ground and constitutes the most extensive and most
beautiful interglacier on Mount Rainier. It originates
in the hollow east side of Little Tahoma itself and
descends rapidly northward, overlooking the great
Emmons Glacier and finally reaching down almost to
its level. It is not a long time since the two ice bodies
were confluent.</p>

<p>The eastern portion of the Fryingpan Glacier drains
northeastward and sends forth several cascading torrents
which, uniting with others coming from the lesser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
ice fields to the east, form the Fryingpan River, a
brisk stream that joins White River several miles
farther north.</p>

<p>Below the Fryingpan Glacier there lies a region of
charming flower-dotted meadows named Summerland,
a most attractive spot for camping.</p>

<p>Cloaking almost the entire east side of Mount Rainier
is the Emmons Glacier, the most extensive ice stream
on the peak (named after Samuel F. Emmons, the
geologist and mountaineer who was the second to
conquer the peak in 1870). About 5&#189; miles long and
1&#190; miles wide in its upper half, it covers almost 8
square miles of territory. It makes a continuous
descent from the summit to the base, the rim of the old
crater having almost completely broken down under
its heavy névé cascades. But two small remnants of
the rim still protrude through the ice and divide it into
three cascades. From each of these dark rock islands
trails a long medial moraine that extends in an ever-broadening
band down to the foot of the glacier.</p>

<p>Conspicuous lateral moraines accompany the ice
stream on each side. There are several parallel ridges
of this sort, disposed in successive tiers above each
other on the valley sides. Most impressively do they
attest the extent of the Emmons Glacier's recent shrinking.
The youngest moraine, fresh looking as if deposited
only yesterday, lies but 50 feet above the glacier's
surface and a scant 100 feet distant from its edge; the
older ridges, subdued in outline, and already tinged
with verdure, lie several hundred feet higher on the
slope.</p>

<p>The Emmons Glacier, like the Nisqually and the
Cowlitz, becomes densely littered with morainal débris
at its lower end, maintaining, however, for a considerable
distance a central lane of clear ice. The stream
which it sends forth, White River, is the largest of
all the ice-fed streams radiating from the peak. It
flows northward and then turns in a northwesterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
direction, emptying finally in Puget Sound at the city
of Seattle.</p>

<p>On the northeast side of the mountain, descending
from the same high névés as the Emmons Glacier, is
the Winthrop Glacier. Not until halfway down, at
an elevation of about 10,000 feet, does it detach itself
as a separate ice stream. The division takes place at
the apex of that great triangular interspace so aptly
named "the Wedge." Upon its sharp cliff edge,
Steamboat Prow, the descending névés part, it has
been said, like swift-flowing waters upon the dividing
bow of a ship at anchor. The simile is an excellent
one; even the long foam crest, rising along the ship's
side, is represented by a wave of ice.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Wedge formerly headed much
higher up on the mountain's flank. Perhaps it extended
upward in the form of a long, attenuated
"cleaver." It is easy to see how the ice masses impinging
upon it have reduced it to successively lower
levels. They are still unrelentingly at work. It is on
the back of the Wedge, it may be added here, that is
situated that small ice body which Maj. Ingraham
named the "Interglacier." That name has since been
applied in a generic sense to all similar ice bodies lying
on the backs of "wedges."</p>

<p>Of greatest interest on the Winthrop Glacier are
the ice cascades and domes. Evidently the glacier's
bed is a very uneven one, giving rise to falls and pools,
such as one observes in a turbulent trout stream. The
cascades explain themselves readily enough, but the
domes require a word of interpretation. They are
underlain by rounded bosses of especially resistant
rock. Over these the ice is lifted, much as is the
water of a swift mountain torrent over submerged
bowlders. Immediately above each obstruction the
ice appears compact and free from crevasses, but as
it reaches the top and begins to pour over it breaks,
and a network of intersecting cracks divides it into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
erect, angular blocks and fantastic obelisks. Below
each dome there is, as a rule, a deep hollow partly inclosed
by trailing ice ridges, analogous to the whirling
eddy that occurs normally below a bowlder in a
brook. Thus does a glacier simulate a stream of
water even in its minor details.</p>

<p>The domes of the Winthrop Glacier measure 50 to
60 feet in height. A sample of the kind of obstruction
that produces them appears, as if specially provided
to satisfy human curiosity, near the terminus of the
glacier. There one may see, close to the west wall of
the troughlike bed, a projecting rock mass, rounded
and smoothly polished, over which the glacier rode but
a short time ago.</p>

<p>Another feature of interest sometimes met with on
the Winthrop Glacier, and for that matter also on the
other ice streams of Mount Rainier, are the "glacier
tables." These consist of slabs of rock mounted each
on a pedestal of snow and producing the effect of huge
toadstools. The slabs are always of large size, while
the pedestals vary from a few inches to several feet
in height.</p>

<p>The origin of the rocks may be traced to cliffs of
incoherent volcanic materials that disintegrate under
the frequent alternations of frost and thaw and send
down periodic rock avalanches, the larger fragments
of which bound out far upon the glacier's surface.</p>

<p>The snow immediately under these large fragments
is effectually protected from the sun and does not melt,
while the surrounding snow, being unprotected, is
constantly wasting away, often at the rate of several
inches per day. Thus in time each rock is left poised
on a column of its own conserving. There is, however,
a limit to the height which such a column can
attain, for as soon as it begins to exceed a certain
height the protecting shadow of the capping stone no
longer reaches down to the base of the pedestal and
the slanting rays of the sun soon undermine it. More
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
commonly, however, the south side of the column
becomes softened both by heat transmitted from the
sun-warmed south edge of the stone, as well as by heat
reflected from the surrounding glacier surface, and as
a consequence the table begins to tilt. On very hot
days, in fact, the inclination of the table keeps pace
with the progress of the sun, much after the manner
of a sun-loving flower, the slant being to the southeast
in the forenoon and to the southwest in the afternoon.
As the snow pillar increases in height it becomes
more and more exposed and the tilting is accentuated,
until at last the rock slides down.</p>

<p>In its new position the slab at once begins to generate
a new pedestal, from which in due time it again
slides down, and so the process may be repeated several
times in the course of a single summer, the rock shifting
its location by successive slips an appreciable distance
across the glacier in a southerly direction.</p>

<p>As has been stated, the slabs on glacier tables are
always of large size. This is not a fortuitous circumstance;
rocks under a certain size, and especially fragments
of little thickness, cannot produce pedestals; in
fact, far from conserving the snow under them, they
accelerate its melting and sink below the surface. This
is especially true of dark-colored rocks. Objects of
dark color, as is well known to physicists, have a faculty
for absorbing heat, whereas light-colored objects, especially
white ones, reflect it best. Dark-colored fragments
of rock lying on a glacier, accordingly, warm
rapidly at their upper surface and, if thin, forthwith
transmit their heat to the snow under them, causing it
to melt much faster than the surrounding clean snow,
which, because of its very whiteness, reflects a large
percentage of the heat it receives from the sun. As a
consequence each small rock fragment and even each
separate dust particle on a glacier melts out a tiny well
of its own, as a rule not vertically downward but at a
slight inclination in the direction of the noonday sun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
And thus, in some localities, one may behold the apparently
incongruous spectacle of large and heavy
rocks supported on snow pillars alongside of little
fragments that have sunk into the ice.</p>

<p>There is also a limit to the depth which the little
wells may attain; as they deepen, the rock fragment
at the bottom receives the sun heat each day for a
progressively shorter period, until at last it receives so
little that its rate of sinking becomes less than that of
the melting glacier surface. Nevertheless it will be
clear that the presence of scattered rock débris on a
glacier must greatly augment the rate of melting, as
it fairly honeycombs the ice and increases the number
of melting surfaces. Wherever the débris is dense, on
the other hand, and accumulates on the glacier in a
heavy layer, its effect becomes a protective one and
surface melting is retarded instead of accelerated. The
dirt-covered lower ends of the glaciers of Mount
Rainier are thus to be regarded as in a measure preserved
by the débris that cloaks them; their life is
greatly prolonged by the unsightly garment.</p>

<p>In many ways the most interesting of all the ice
streams on Mount Rainier is the Carbon Glacier, the
great ice river on the north side, which flows between
those two charming natural gardens, Moraine Park
and Spray Park. The third glacier in point of length,
it heads, curiously, not on the summit, but in a profound,
walled-in amphitheater, inset low into the
mountain's flank. This amphitheater is what is technically
known as a glacial cirque, a horseshoe-shaped
basin elaborated by the ice from a deep gash that
existed originally in the volcano's side. It has the
distinction of being the largest of all the ice-sculptured
cirques on Mount Rainier, and one of the grandest
in the world. It measures more than a mile and a
half in diameter, while its head wall towers a sheer
3,600 feet. So well proportioned is the great hollow,
however, and so simple are its outlines that the eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
finds difficulty in correctly estimating the dimensions.
Not until an avalanche breaks from the 300-foot
névé cliff above and hurls itself over the precipice with
crashing thunder, does one begin to realize the depth
of the colossal recess. The falling snow mass is several
seconds in descending, and though weighing hundreds
of tons, seemingly floats down with the leisureliness of
a feather.</p>

<p>These avalanches were once believed to be the authors
of the cirque. They were thought to have worn back
the head wall little by little, even as a waterfall causes
the cliff under it to recede. But the real manner in
which glacial cirques evolve is better understood to-day.
It is now known that cirques are produced
primarily by the eroding action of the ice masses embedded
in them. Slowly creeping forward, these ice
masses, shod as they are with débris derived from the
encircling cliffs, scour and scoop out their hollow sites,
and enlarge and deepen them by degrees. Seconding
this work is the rock-splitting action of water freezing
in the interstices of the rock walls. This process is
particularly effective in the great cleft at the glacier's
head, between ice and cliff. This abyss is periodically
filled with fresh snows, which freeze to the rock; then,
as the glacier moves away, it tears or plucks out the
frost-split fragments from the wall. Thus the latter
is continually being undercut. The overhanging portions
fall down, as decomposition lessens their cohesion,
and so the entire cliff recedes.</p>

<p>A glacier, accordingly, may be said, literally, to gnaw
headward into the mountain. But, as it does so, it
also attacks the cliffs that flank it, and as a consequence,
the depression in which it lies tends to widen and to become
semicircular in plan. In its greatest perfection
a glacial cirque is horseshoe-shaped in outline. The
Carbon Glacier's amphitheater, it will be noticed, consists
really of two twin cirques, separated by an angular
buttress. But this projection, which is the remnant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of a formerly long spur dividing the original cavity,
is fast being eliminated by the undermining process,
so that in time the head wall will describe a smooth,
uninterrupted horseshoe curve.</p>

<p>In its headward growth the Carbon Glacier, as one
may readily observe on the map, has encroached considerably
upon the summit platform of the mountain,
the massive northwest portion of the crater rim of which
Liberty Cap is the highest point. In so doing it has
made great inroads upon the névé fields that send down
the avalanches, and has reduced this source of supply.
On the other hand, by deploying laterally, the glacier
has succeeded in capturing part of the névés formerly
tributary to the ice fields to the west, and has made
good some of the losses due to its headward cutting.
But, after all, these are events of relatively slight
importance in the glacier's career; for like the lower
ice fields of the Nisqually, and like most glaciers on
the lower slopes of the mountain, the Carbon Glacier
is not wholly dependent upon the summit névés for
its supply of ice. The avalanches, imposing though
they are, contribute but a minor portion of its total
bulk. Most of its mass is derived directly from the
low hanging snow clouds, or is blown into the cirque by
eddying winds. How abundantly capable these agents
are to create large ice bodies at low altitudes is convincingly
demonstrated by the extensive névé fields
immediately west of the Carbon Glacier, for which the
name Russell Glacier has recently been proposed. It
is to be noted, however, that these ice fields lie spread
out on shelves fairly exposed to sun and wind. How
much better adapted for the accumulation of snow is
the Carbon Glacier's amphitheater! Not only does
it constitute an admirably designed catchment basin
for wind-blown snow, but an effective conserver of the
névés collecting in it. Opening to the north only, its
encircling cliffs thoroughly shield the contained ice
mass from the sun. By its very form, moreover, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
tends to prolong the glacier's life, for the latter lies
compactly in the hollow with a relatively small surface
exposed to melting. The cirque, therefore, is at once
the product of the glacier and its generator and conserver.</p>

<p>Of the lower course of the Carbon Glacier little need
here be said, as it does not differ materially from the
lower courses of the glaciers already described. It
may be mentioned, however, that toward its terminus
the glacier makes a steep descent and develops a
series of parallel medial moraines and that it reaches
down to an elevation of 3,365 feet, almost 600 feet
lower than any other ice stream on Mount Rainier.
A beautiful cave usually forms at the point of exit of
the Carbon River.</p>

<p>West of the profound canyon of the Carbon River,
there rises a craggy range which the Indians have
named the Mother Mountains. From its narrow backbone
one looks down on either side into broadly open,
semicircular valley heads. Some drain northward to
the Carbon River, some southward to the Mowich
River. Encircling them run attenuated rock partitions,
surmounted by low, angular peaks; while cutting
across their stairwise descending floors are precipitous
steps of rock, a hundred feet in height. On
the treads lie scattered shallow lakelets, strung together
by little silvery brooks trickling in capricious
courses.</p>

<p>Most impressive is the basin that lies immediately
under the west end of the range. Smoothly rounded
like a bowl, it holds in its center an almost circular
lake of vivid emerald hue&mdash;that mysterious body of
water known as Crater Lake. Let it be said at once
that this appellation is an unfortunate misnomer. The
basin is not of volcanic origin. It lies in lava and other
volcanic rocks, to be sure, but these are merely spreading
layers of the cone of Mount Rainier. Ice is the
agent responsible for the carving of the hollow. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
was once the cradle of a glacier, and that ice mass,
gnawing headward and deploying even as the Carbon
Glacier does to-day, enlarged its site into a horseshoe
basin, a typical glacial cirque. The lake in the center
is a strictly normal feature; many glacial cirques
possess such bowls, scooped out by the eroding ice
masses from the weaker portions of the rock floor;
only it is seldom that such features acquire the symmetry
of form exhibited by Crater Lake. The lakelets
observed in the neighboring valley heads&mdash;all of
which are abandoned cirques&mdash;are of similar origin.</p>

<p>As for the skeleton character of the dividing crests,
it will be readily seen to be the outcome of the headward
gnawing of opposing cirques. In some places, even,
the deploying process has attenuated the ridges sufficiently
to break them through. West of Crater
Lake is an instance of a crest that has thus been
breached.</p>

<p>It is a significant fact that the empty cirques about
the Mother Mountains lie at elevations ranging between
4,500 and 6,000 feet; that is, on an average 5,000 feet
lower than the cirques on Mount Rainier which now
produce glaciers. Evidently the snow line in glacial
times lay at a much lower level than it does to-day,
and the ice mantle of Mount Rainier expanded not
merely by the forward lengthening of its ice tongues but
by the birth of numerous new glaciers about the mountain's
foot. The large size of the empty cirques and
canyons, moreover, leads one to infer that many of
these new glaciers far exceeded in volume the ice
streams descending the volcano's sides. The latter, it
is true, increased considerably in thickness during
glacial times, but not in proportion to the growth
of the low-level glaciers. Nor is this surprising in
view of the heavy snow falls occurring on the mountain's
lower slopes. There is good reason to believe,
moreover, that the cool glacial climate resulted in a
general lowering of the zone of heaviest snowfall. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
probably was depressed to levels between 4,000 and
6,000 feet. Not only the cirque glaciers about the
Mother Mountains, but all the neighboring ice streams
of the glacial epoch originated within this zone, as is
indicated by the altitudes of the cirques throughout
the adjoining portions of the Cascade Range. By their
confluence these ice bodies produced a great system of
glaciers that filled all the valleys of this mountain belt
and even protruded beyond its western front.</p>

<p>To these extensive valley glaciers the ice flows of
Mount Rainier stood in the relation of mere tributaries.
They descended from regions of rather scant
snowfall, for the peak in those days of frigid climate
rose some 10,000 feet above the zone of heaviest snowfall,
into atmospheric strata of relative dryness. It
may well be, indeed, that it carried then but little more
snow upon its summit than it does to-day.</p>

<p>The North Mowich Glacier is the northernmost of
the series of ice bodies on the west flank of Mount
Rainier. Like the Carbon Glacier, it heads in a cirque
at the base of the Liberty Cap massif, fed by direct
snow precipitation, by wind drifting, and by avalanches.
The cirque is small and shallow, not as
capacious even as either of the twin recesses in the
Carbon Glacier's amphitheater. As a consequence the
ice stream issuing from it is of only moderate volume;
nevertheless it attains a length of 3&#190; miles. This is due
in part to the heavy snows that reënforce it throughout
its middle course and in part to overflows from the
ice fields bordering it on the south. These ice fields,
almost extensive enough to be considered a distinct
glacier, are separated from the North Mowich Glacier
only by a row of pinnacles, the remnants evidently of
a narrow rock partition or "cleaver," now demolished
by the ice. The lowest and most prominent of the
rock spires bears the appropriate name of "The Needle"
(7,587 feet).</p>

<p>The débris-covered lower end of the glacier splits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
into two short lobes on a rounded boss in the middle
of the channel. This boss, but a short time ago, was
overridden by the glacier and then undoubtedly gave
rise to an ice dome of the kind so numerous farther
up on the North Mowich Glacier and also characteristic
of the Winthrop Glacier.</p>

<p>Separated from the ice fields of the North Mowich
Glacier by a great triangular ice field (named Edmunds
Glacier) lies the South Mowich Glacier, also a
cirque-born ice stream, heading against the base of
the Liberty Cap massif. It is the shortest of the
western glaciers, measuring only a scant 3 miles.
Aside from the snows accumulating in its ill-shaped
cirque it receives strong reënforcements from its neighbor
to the south&mdash;the Puyallup Glacier.</p>

<p>Toward its lower end it splits into two unequal lobes,
the southernmost of which is by far the longer. Sharp
cut rock wedges beyond its front show that when the
glacier extended farther down it split again and again.</p>

<p>The north lobe is of interest because the stream that
cascades from the Edmunds Glacier runs for a considerable
distance under it. In the near future the
lobe is likely to recede sufficiently to enable the torrent
to pass unhindered by its front.</p>

<p>What especially distinguishes the Puyallup Glacier
from its neighbors to the north is the great elevation
of its cirque. The Carbon, North Mowich, and
South Mowich Glaciers all head at levels of about
10,000 feet. The amphitheater of the Puyallup Glacier,
on the contrary, opens a full 2,000 feet higher
up. Encircled by a great vertical wall that cuts into the
Liberty Cap platform from the south, it has evidently
developed through glacial sapping from a hollow of
volcanic origin. From this great reservoir the Puyallup
Glacier descends by a rather narrow chute. Then
it expands again to a width of three-fourths of a mile
and sends a portion of its volume to the South Mowich
Glacier. In spite of this loss it continues to expand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
reaching a maximum width of a mile and a total length
of 4 miles. No doubt this is accounted for by the
heavy snowfalls that replenish it throughout its course.</p>

<p>Its lower end consists of a tortuous ice lobe that
describes a beautiful curve, flanked on the north by
a vertical lava cliff. A lesser lobe splits off to the
south on a wedge of rock.</p>

<p>Immediately south of the elevated amphitheater of
the Puyallup Glacier the crater rim of the volcano is
breached for a distance of half a mile. Through this
gap tumbles a voluminous cascade from the névé fields
about the summit, and this cascade, reënforced by a
flow from the Puyallup cirque, forms the great Tahoma
Glacier, the most impressive ice stream on the southwest
side. Separated from its northern neighbor by
a rock cleaver of remarkable length and straightness,
it flows in a direct course for a distance of 5 miles. Its
surface, more than a mile broad in places, is diversified
by countless ice falls and cataracts.</p>

<p>A mere row of isolated pinnacles indicates its eastern
border, and across the gaps in this row its névés coalesce
with those of the South Tahoma Glacier. Farther
down the two ice streams abruptly part company
and flow in wide detours around a cliff-girt, castellated
rock mass&mdash;Glacier Island it has been named. The
Tahoma Glacier, about a mile above its terminus,
spits upon a low, verdant wedge and sends a lobe southward
which skirts the walls of this island rock, and at
its base meets again the South Tahoma Glacier. From
here on the two ice streams merge and form a single
densely débris-laden mass, so chaotic in appearance
that one would scarcely take it for a glacier. Numerous
rivulets course over its dark surface only to disappear
in mysterious holes and clefts. Profound, circular
kettles filled with muddy water often develop on
it during the summer months, and after a brief existence
empty themselves again by subglacial passages
or by a newly formed crevasse. So abundant is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
rock débris released by melting that the wind at times
whips it up into veritable dust storms.</p>

<p>Beautifully regular moraines accompany the ice mass
on both sides, giving clear evidence of its recent shrinking.</p>

<p>The partner of the Tahoma Glacier, known as the
South Tahoma Glacier, heads in a profound cirque
sculptured in the flanks of the great buttress that
culminates in Peak Success (14,150 feet). It is interesting
chiefly as an example of a cirque-born glacier,
nourished almost exclusively by direct snowfalls from
the clouds and by eddying winds. In spite of its position,
exposed to the midday sun, it attains a length
of nearly 4 miles, a fact which impressively attests
the ampleness of its ice supply.</p>

<p>In glacial times the glacier had a much greater volume
and rose high enough to override the south half
of Glacier Island, as is clearly shown by the glacial
grooves and the scattered ice-worn bowlders on that
eminence. As the glacier shrank it continued for some
time to send a lobe through the gulch in the middle of
the island. Even now a portion of this lobe remains,
but it no longer connects with the Tahoma Glacier.</p>

<p>An excellent nearby view of the lower cascades of the
South Tahoma Glacier may be had from the ice-scarred
rock platform west of Pyramid Rock. From that point,
as well as from the other heights of [Indian] Henrys
Hunting Ground, one may enjoy a panorama of ice and
rock such as is seen in only few places on this continent.</p>

<p>East of the South Tahoma Glacier, heading against
a great cleaver that descends from Peak Success, lies
a triangular ice field, or interglacier, named Pyramid
Glacier. It covers a fairly smooth, gently sloping platform
underlain by a heavy lava bed, and breaking off
at its lower edge in precipitous, columnar cliffs. Into
this platform a profound but narrow box canyon has
been incised by an ice stream descending from the summit
névés east of Peak Success. This is the Kautz
Glacier, an ice stream peculiar for its exceeding slenderness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
On the map it presents almost a worm-like appearance,
heightened perhaps by its strongly sinuous
course. In spite of its meager width, which averages
about 1,000 feet, the ice stream attains a length of
almost 4 miles and descends to an altitude of 4,800
feet. This no doubt is to be attributed in large measure
to the protecting influence of the box canyon.</p>

<p>It receives one tributary of importance, the Success
Glacier, which heads in a cirque against the flanks of
Peak Success. This ice stream supplies probably one-third
of the total bulk of the Kautz Glacier, as one
may infer from the position of the medial moraine that
develops at the point of confluence. In the lower
course of the glacier this medial moraine grows in
width and height until it assumes the proportions of
a massive ridge, occupying about one-third of the
breadth of the ice stream's surface.</p>

<p>A singularly fascinating spectacle is that which the
moraine-covered lower end of the glacier presents from
the heights of Van Trump Park. A full 1,000 feet
down one looks upon the ice stream as it curves around
a sharp bend in its canyon.</p>

<p>A short distance below the glacier's terminus, the
canyon contracts abruptly to a gorge only 300 feet in
width. So resistant is the columnar basalt in this
locality that the ice has been unable to hew out a wider
passage. Not its entire volume, however, was squeezed
through the narrow portal; there is abundant evidence
showing that in glacial times when the ice stream was
more voluminous it overrode the rock buttresses on
the west side of the gorge.</p>

<p>The name of P. B. Van Trump, the hardy pioneer
climber of Mount Rainier, has been attached to the
interglacier situated between the Kautz and the Nisqually
Glaciers. This ice body lies on the uneven surface
of an extensive wedge that tapers upward to a
sharp point&mdash;one of the remnants of the old crater
rim. A number of small ice fields are distributed on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
this wedge, each ensconced in a hollow inclosed more
or less completely by low ridges. By gradually deploying
each of these ice bodies has enlarged its site,
and thus the dividing ridges have been converted into
slender rock walls or cleavers. In many places they
have even been completely consumed and the ice
fields coalesce. The Van Trump Glacier is the most
extensive of these composite ice fields. The rapid
melting which it has suffered in the last decades, however,
has gone far toward dismembering it; already
several small ice strips are threatening to become
separated from the main body.</p>

<p>In glacial times the Van Trump Glacier sent forth
at least six lobes, most of which converged farther
down in the narrow valleys traversing the attractive
alpine region now known as Van Trump Park. This
upland park owes its scenic charm largely to its manifold
glacial features and is diversified by cirques, canyons,
lakelets, moraines, and waterfalls.</p>

<p>In the foregoing descriptions the endeavor has been
to make clear how widely the glaciers of Mount Rainier
differ in character, in situation, and in size. They
are not to be conceived as mere ice tongues radiating
down the slopes of the volcano from an ice cap on its
crown. There is no ice cap, properly speaking, and
there has perhaps never been one at any time in the
mountain's history, not even during the glacial epochs.</p>

<p>Several of the main ice streams head in the névés
gathering about the summit craters, but a larger number
originate in profound amphitheaters carved in the
mountain's flanks, at levels fully 4,000 feet below the
summit. In the general distribution of the glaciers
the low temperatures prevailing at high altitudes have,
of course, been a controlling factor; nevertheless in
many instances their influence has been outbalanced
by topographic features favoring local snow accumulation
and by the heavy snowfalls occurring on the
lower slopes.</p>

XV. THE ROCKS OF MOUNT RAINIER<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> GEORGE OTIS SMITH</small></h2>

<blockquote><p class="hang">Director George Otis Smith of the United States Geological
Survey was born at Hodgdon, Maine, on February 22, 1871.
He graduated from Colby College in 1893 and obtained his
Doctor of Philosophy degree from Johns Hopkins University
in 1896. He had begun his geological work in 1893 and from
1896 to 1907 he was assistant geologist and geologist of the
United States Geological Survey. Since 1907 he has been
director of that important branch of the Government work.</p>

<p class="hang">He had been studying the rocks of Mount Rainier before he joined
Professor Russell in the explorations of 1896. The record of
those studies was published at the same time as Professor
Russell's report in the Eighteenth Annual Report of the
United States Geological Survey for 1896-1897. With his
permission the record is here reproduced in full. So far as is
known to the present editor it is the most complete study yet
published on the rocks of Mount Rainier.</p></blockquote>


<p>The earliest geological observations on the structure
of Mount Rainier were made in 1870 by S. F.
Emmons, of the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth
Parallel. The rock specimens collected at this time
were studied later by Messrs. Hague and Iddings, of
the United States Geological Survey.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This petrographical
study showed that "Mount Rainier is formed
almost wholly of hypersthene andesite, with different
conditions of groundmass and accompanied by hornblende
and olivine in places." The only other petrographical
study of these volcanics is that of Mr. K.
Oebbeke, of Munich,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
upon a small collection made
on Mount Rainier by Professor Zittel in 1883.</p>

<p>On the reconnaissance trips on the northern and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
eastern slopes of Mount Rainier, during the seasons of
1895 and 1896, the writer had opportunity to make
some general observations on the rocks of this mountain,
and the petrographical material then collected
has since been studied. The observations and collections
were of necessity limited, both by the reconnaissance
character of the examination and by the
mantle of snow and ice which covers so large a part of
this volcanic cone.</p>

<p>Two classes of rock are to be discussed as occurring
on Mount Rainier: the lavas and pyroclastics which
compose the volcanic cone and the granitic rocks
forming the platform upon which the volcano was
built up.</p>


<p class="center space-above"><span class="smcap">Volcanic Rocks</span></p>

<p class="center"><small>GEOLOGIC RELATIONS</small></p>

<p>On Crater Peak a dark line of rock appears above
the snow, and here the outer slope of the crater rim is
found to be covered with blocks of lava. A black,
loose-textured andesite is most abundant, and from
its occurrence on the edge of this well-defined crater
may be regarded as representing the later eruptions of
Rainier. Lower down on the slopes of the mountain
opportunities for the study of the structure of the
volcanic cone are found in the bold rock masses that
mark the apexes of the interglacial areas. Examples
of these are Little Tahoma, Gibraltar, Cathedral
Rock, the Wedge, and the Guardian Rocks. These
remnants of the old surface of the cone, together with
the cliffs that bound the lower courses of the glaciers,
exhibit the structural relations very well.</p>

<p>Even when viewed from a distance these cliffs and
peaks are seen to be composed of bedded material.
Projecting ledges interrupt the talus slopes and express
differences of hardness in the several beds, while
variations in color also indicate separate lava flows
and agglomeratic deposits. Gibraltar is thus seen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
be composed of interbedded lavas and pyroclastics,
and on the Wedge a similar alternation is several times
repeated, a pink agglomerate being exceptionally
striking in appearance.</p>

<p>These lava flows and beds of volcanic ejectamenta
thus exposed dip away from the summit at a low
angle. The steepest dip observed was in the amphitheater
at the head of Carbon Glacier, where in the
dividing spur the dip to the northeast is about 30°.
Some exceptions in the inclination of the beds were
noted on the southeastern slope, where in a few cases
the layers are horizontal, or even dip toward the
central axis of the cone. In general, however, the
volcanics composing Mount Rainier may be said to
dip away from the summit at an angle somewhat lower
than that of the slopes of the present cone. In the
outlying ridges to the north, the Mother Range,
Crescent Mountain, and the Sluiskin Mountains, the
structure seems to be that of interbedded volcanics
approximately horizontal. The extent of the volcanics
from the center of eruption has not been determined.
Similar lava extends to the south, beyond the Tattoosh
Range, and volcanics of similar composition occur to
the north, in the Tacoma quadrangle. The latter
lavas and tuffs may have originated from smaller and
less important cones, now destroyed by erosion.</p>

<p>A radial dike was observed at only one locality,
near the base of Little Tahoma. In several cases the
lava masses, as seen in cross section, are lens-shaped,
and where associated with fragmental beds have
unconformable relations. This shows that some of
the lava flows took the form of streams, relatively
narrow, rather than of broad sheets. Such a feature
is in accord with the distribution of rock types. Thus
along Ptarmigan Ridge for considerable vertical and
horizontal range the rock shows only slight variation.
The distribution of rock types will be more fully discussed
in a later paragraph.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Of how large a part of the lava flows the crater still
remaining was the point of origin is a question to be
answered only after more detailed observation has
been made. The best section for the study of the succession
of flows and ejectamenta is the amphitheater
at the head of the Carbon Glacier. The 4,000 feet of
rock in this bold wall would afford an excellent opportunity
for this were it not that frequent avalanches
preclude the possibility of geologic study except at
long range.</p>


<p class="center"><small>MEGASCOPIC CHARACTERS</small></p>

<p>The volcanic rocks of Rainier are of varying color and
texture. Dense black rocks with abundant phenocrysts
of glassy feldspars, rough and coarse lavas of different
tints of pink, red, and purple, and compact light-gray
rocks are some of the types represented upon the slopes
of this volcanic cone. In color, the majority of the
rocks may be grouped together as light gray to dark
gray. The black and red lavas are less common. In
texture, the Rainier lavas are, for the most part, compact.
Slaggy and scoriaceous phases are common,
but probably represent only a small part of the different
flows. Near the Guardian Rocks large masses of
ropy lava are found which suggest ejected bombs.
Agglomeratic and tuffaceous rocks are of quite common
occurrence, although less important than the
lavas. Vesicular lavas occur at several localities,
and fragments of a light-olive pumice, many as large
as a foot in diameter, wholly cover some of the long,
gentle slopes southeast of Little Tahoma and in Moraine
Park.</p>

<p>Contraction parting or jointing is often observed,
being especially characteristic of the basaltic types.
The platy parting is the more common, but the columnar
or prismatic parting is well exhibited at several
localities. The black basaltic lava east of Cowlitz
Glacier shows the latter structure in a striking manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
The blocks resemble pigs of iron in size and shape,
and where exposed in a vertical cliff these seem to be
piled in various positions.</p>

<p>The rocks on the higher slopes of Mount Rainier are
in general very fresh in appearance. An exception
may be noted in the case of the rocks at the base of
Little Tahoma, where some alteration is evident. The
bright coloring of the surfaces of the lava blocks and
the general appearance of the face of the cliff may indicate
fumarole action at this point. There is also
some decomposition along the inner edge of the crater
rim, near the steam vents. On the lower slopes, some
distance below the snow line, the freshness of the rock
is not a noticeable feature, and it is seen that here
weathering is of the nature of chemical decomposition
as well as of mechanical disintegration.</p>


<p class="center"><small>MICROSCOPIC CHARACTERS</small></p>

<p>Microscopically these lavas show more uniformity
than is apparent megascopically. Rocks which in
color and texture appear quite diverse are found to be
mineralogical equivalents. The majority of these rocks
are andesites, the hypersthene-andesites predominating,
as was shown by Hague and Iddings; but over
large areas the andesites are decidedly basaltic, and,
indeed, many of the lavas are basalts. The megascopic
differences are mostly referable to groundmass
characters, the color of the rock being dependent upon
the color and proportion of glassy base present. Therefore
the degree of crystallization of groundmass constituents
is of more importance in determining the
megascopic appearance than is the mineralogical composition,
and the basaltic lavas are for the most part
light gray in color, while the more acid hypersthene-andesites
are often black or red.</p>

<p>In petrographic character the lavas range from hypersthene-andesite
to basalt. This variation is dependent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
upon the ferromagnesian silicates, and four rock types
are represented&mdash;hypersthene-andesite, pyroxene-andesite,
augite-andesite, and basalt&mdash;any of which
may carry small amounts of hornblende. A rigid
separation of these rock types, however, is impossible,
since insensible gradations connect the most acid with
the most basic. In the same flow hypersthene-andesite
may occur in one portion, while in close proximity the
lava is an augite-andesite.</p>

<p>These lavas have groundmass textures that vary
from almost holo-crystalline to glassy. The felted or
hyalopilitic texture is the most common, and plagioclase
is the principal groundmass constituent. The
feldspars are lath-shaped, often with castellated terminations.
In the more basic phases anhedrons of augite
and of olivine appear, and magnetite grains are usually
present. Flowage is often beautifully expressed by the
arrangement of the slender laths of feldspar.</p>

<p>Among the phenocrysts feldspar is the most prominent.
It has the usual twinning characteristic of
plagioclase and belongs to the andesine-labradorite
series, extinction angles proving basic andesine and
acid labradorite to be the most common. Zonal
structure is characteristic, being noticeable even without
the use of polarized light. Zonal arrangement of
glass inclusions testifies to the vicissitudes of crystallization,
and often the core of a feldspar phenocryst
is seen to have suffered corrosion by the magma and
subsequently to have been repaired with a zone of
feldspar more acid in composition.</p>

<p>Of the darker phenocrysts, the pyroxenes are
more abundant than the olivine or hornblende. Hypersthene
and augite occur alone or together, and
are readily distinguished by their different crystallographic
habits as well as by their optical properties.
The hypersthene is usually more perfectly idiomorphic
and occurs in long prisms, with the pinacoidal planes
best developed, while the augite is in stout prisms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
usually twinned. Both are light colored, and the
pleochroism of the hypersthene is sometimes quite
faint. According to the relative importance of
these two pyroxenes, the lavas belong to different
types, hypersthene-andesite, pyroxene-andesite, or
augite-andesite.</p>

<p>Olivine occurs in certain of the Rainier lavas, in
stout prisms somewhat rounded and often with reddened
borders. The usual association with apatite
and magnetite crystals is noted. The olivine varies
much in relative abundance, so as to be considered now
an accessory and now an essential constituent, and in
the latter case the rock is a basalt.</p>

<p>Hornblende is not abundant in any of the rocks
studied, although typical hornblende-andesite has been
described among the specimens collected by Professor
Zittel. Where it occurs it is in brown crystals, which
have usually suffered magmatic alteration. In one
case, where this alteration is less marked, the idiomorphic
hornblende is found to inclose a crystal of labradorite,
and thus must have been one of the latest
phenocrysts to crystallize. It also surrounds olivine
in this same rock,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
which is a hypersthene-andesite,
the hornblende and olivine being only accessory.</p>

<p>The different textures of these lavas are doubtless
expressive primarily of diversity in the physical conditions
of consolidation, but also in part of variations
in chemical composition. The variations in mineralogical
composition are likewise referable to these two
factors, but here the latter is the more important.
The hypersthene-augite olivine variation, already referred
to, doubtless well expresses the chemical composition
of the magma, and deserves to be taken as the
chief criterion in the classification of the lavas. As was
noted by Hague and Iddings, the hypersthene and
olivine play a like rôle, the former occurring when the
silica percentage is somewhat higher than in basalt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
It is exceptional to find the two in the same specimen,
the one being absent whenever the other is present.
The following analysis<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
of the typical hypersthene-andesite
from Crater Peak shows the lava to be a comparatively
acid andesite:</p>

<p>An analysis<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
of one of the light-gray, olivine-bearing
rocks on the northern slope of the mountain gives a
silica percentage of 54.86, and is doubtless representative
of the more basic of the Rainier lavas.</p>

<p>The sporadic occurrence of hornblende in these
andesites is principally the result of physical conditions
rather than of chemical composition. The magmatic
alteration of the phenocrysts of hornblende
affords evidence of this variation in consolidation conditions,
a diminution of pressure with continuance of
slow cooling giving rise to the magmatic alteration of
the hornblende. That this change took place during
the later stages of consolidation is shown by the relative
age of the hornblende, noted above, and also by the
fact that in one case a phenocryst of augite, where it
abuts against the hornblende, has protected the latter
from this alteration. The alteration is in part pseudomorphic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the hornblende retaining its characteristic
outlines, but often there has been resorption. In
one andesite the abundance of these remnants of
hornblende and also of augite anhedrons in the groundmass
may justify the conclusion that this augite
andesite is of derivative origin, of the class described
by Washington.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
It may be noted also that hypersthene
shows a tendency to magmatic alteration,
although only rarely.</p>

<p>In a basal flow in Moraine Park, the slaggy and
compact phases show differences in phenocrysts as
well as in groundmass. The glassy rock has hypersthene
as the predominant phenocryst, while feldspar
is the more important in the compact and more crystalline
andesite.</p>

<p>The distribution of the rock types described above
is of interest. On the northern slope of the mountain,
between Willis and Carbon glaciers, the characteristic
lava is a gray andesite, smooth to rough in texture,
and showing platy and columnar parting. Hypersthene
is not the prevailing pyroxene, and olivine is
usually present, often in such abundance as to make the
rock a basalt.</p>

<p>In Moraine Park gray andesites also predominate,
with both pyroxenes as phenocrysts, but here hypersthene
is the more important. On the eastern slope
on the Wedge, between Winthrop and Emmons
glaciers, the lavas are pyroxene-andesites and vary
much in megascopic appearance, although little in
microscopic characters. These rocks are quite distinct
from any seen to the north. The nunatak in
Emmons Glacier is composed of hypersthene-andesite,
but on Little Tahoma the lava shows more variety.
Both augite-andesite and hypersthene-andesite occur,
while at the southern end of this interglacial rock mass,
just east of Cowlitz Glacier, the cliffs are composed of
the prismatic black basalt. On Crater Peak, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
below on Gibraltar, hypersthene andesite occurs with
considerable variation of color and texture. On the
spurs west of Nisqually Glacier the andesites contain
both pyroxenes, the augite being somewhat the more
important.</p>

<p>The distribution of the volcanic rocks, as determined
in the study of reconnaissance collections, indicates
that the cone has been built up by eruptions of
lava and of fragmental material. The successive lava
streams were doubtless of considerable thickness, but
were limited in lateral extent. The beds of fragmental
material are of the nature of flow breccias and of coarse
agglomerates on the higher slopes, while tuffs occur at
a greater distance from the center of eruption. This
composite cone appears to be remarkably free from
radial dikes, which may indicate that the volcanic
energy was expended chiefly at the crater. The
variation in rock types on different sides of the volcanic
cone may be evidence of changes in position of the
center of eruption. The destruction of an earlier
crater and the eccentric position of a later would give
rise to such a radial distribution of lavas as has been
described above.</p>


<p class="center space-above"><span class="smcap">Granite</span></p>

<p class="center"><small>OCCURRENCE</small></p>

<p>The presence of an acid holocrystalline rock on the
slopes of Mount Rainier was first reported by Lieutenant
Kautz in 1857, from whose accounts Dr. George
Gibbs was led to announce the occurrence of granite
as a dike in recent lavas.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Emmons in 1870 observed
a cliff of "beautiful white syenitic granite" rising
above the foot of Nisqually Glacier and correctly
interpreted the geologic relations. In 1895, on a
reconnaissance trip, the writer identified granite among
the bowlders composing the lateral moraines of Carbon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Glacier, as well as on the surface of the glacier itself,
and in the following season bowlders of granite were
found to be plentiful in the river bed at the foot of
this glacier. This anomaly of granite bowlders coming
from a volcanic peak was also noted in the canyon
of the Nisqually by Emmons.</p>

<p>In the somewhat more careful study of the Mount
Rainier rocks, search was made and the granite was
found in place at several points on the northeastern
slope. A biotite-hornblende-granite was observed on
Carbon River at the mouth of Canada Creek, about 12
miles from the summit of Mount Rainier, and at
Chenuis Falls, 2 miles up the river, a finer grained
holocrystalline rock occurs, apparently an aplitic
phase of the granite. In the lower portion of Carbon
Glacier, near its eastern edge, a nunatak of granite
can be seen, while the same rock occurs farther to the
east, beyond the older of the lateral moraines. Higher
on the slopes of Rainier a more marked ridge of granite
was traced. A knob rises above the eastern moraine
of Carbon Glacier at an altitude of between 7,000 and
8,000 feet, and the more prominent features to the
east in Moraine Park also owe their survival to the
greater erosion-resisting power of the granite.</p>


<p class="center"><small>PETROGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION</small></p>

<p>These granites have few features worthy of special
mention. Hornblende and biotite are the ferromagnesian
constituents and vary much in relative importance.
The variations from hornblende-granite to
biotite-granite occur in the same knob or ridge, and
considering all occurrences the two varieties seem to be
of equal development. There is also some variation
in the amount of quartz present, and in the relative
importance of the orthoclase and plagioclase. All of
these characters are also found in the granites of the
Northern Cascades.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><small>RELATION TO THE VOLCANIC ROCKS</small></p>

<p>Along the side of the knob overlooking Carbon Glacier
the granite as seen from a distance appears to be
intrusive. Blocks of andesite cover the slope, deposited
there by the glacier at a time when it possessed
greater lateral extent, and the granite talus from above
crosses this same slope in a narrow band. The relations
prove less deceptive on close examination, and
the granite is seen to constitute an older ridge. Farther
along this ridge, at the cliffs on the north-eastern
edge of Moraine Park, the granitic rock is found over-lain
by the lava. The actual contact of the two rocks
is concealed by soil filling the crevice left by disintegration
along the contact plane. The granite, however,
exhibits no intrusive characters, while the overlying
andesite becomes scoriaceous in its lower portion,
although compact immediately above. This contact
is on the southern side of the granite ridge, the crest of
which is approximately east-west. This position of
the lava contact considerably below the highest occurrence
of the granite indicates that the topographic features
of this old granite ridge were even more marked
at the time of the eruption of the lavas and the
building of the volcanic cone. Above this ridge of
granite on the one side tower the cliffs of bedded
volcanics which compose the Sluiskin Mountains, and
on the other is the andesite ridge bounding the canyon
of Winthrop Glacier. Thus Mount Rainier, although
a volcanic peak, rests upon an elevated platform
of granite which is exposed by erosion at a few
points on the slopes of the mountain.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></p>

<p>The volcanic rocks of Mount Rainier include both
lavas and pyroclastics. The breccias, agglomerates,
and tuffs, although of striking appearance, are, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
less important elements in the construction of
the composite cone.</p>

<p>The lavas vary much in color and texture, but these
megascopic differences are referable rather to the
degree of crystallization of the magma than to its
chemical character. The variation in the chemical
composition of the lavas expresses itself in mineralogical
differences, and thus four rock types are
distinguished&mdash;hypersthene-andesite, pyroxene-andesite,
augite-andesite, and basalt. The distribution of these
types indicates a radial arrangement of lava streams,
and hypersthene-andesite is the more abundant variety
of lava.</p>

<p>Granite is exposed on the slopes of Rainier where
erosion has cut away the overlying lava, and it is plain
that the volcanic cone rests upon an elevated platform
of older rock, approximately 8,000 feet above sea level.</p>

XVI. THE FLORA OF MOUNT RAINIER<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> PROFESSOR CHARLES V. PIPER</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang">Charles Vancouver Piper was born on Vancouver Island, at
Victoria, British Columbia, on June 16, 1867. He graduated
from the University of Washington in 1885 and since then
has received degrees and honors from other institutions and
learned societies. He was professor of botany and zoölogy
at the Washington Agricultural College (now State College of
Washington) from 1892 to 1903. He has been agrostologist
in charge of forage crop investigations for the Bureau of Plant
Industry, United States Department of Agriculture, since 1903.</p>

<p class="hang">He has discovered many new forms of plant life and has published
many monographs and books in the field of botany. This
account of the flora of Mount Rainier was first published in
The Mazama (Portland, Oregon) in two articles, one in Volume
II, Number 2 (April, 1901), and the other in Volume II,
Number 4 (December, 1905). They are reproduced with the
consent of the editor of The Mazama, and Professor Piper has
revised and amplified them for this purpose.</p></blockquote>

<p>Up to an elevation of 4,000 feet or more the flanks
of Mount Rainier are clothed in a continuous belt of
somber forest, broken only where glaciers and their
nascent streams have hewn pathways, or where, alas,
fire has left desolate slopes marked here and there by
the whitened, weather-worn shaft of some old tree, a
dreary monument to its destroyed fellows. This
forest is composed in its lower reaches largely of Douglas
spruce. Scattered through it in smaller quantities
one finds Lovely fir, Western white pine, Western
hemlock, a few Engelmann spruces, and on the stream
banks cedar and yew, and now and then a little cottonwood.</p>

<p>At about the 3,500-foot level the character of the
forest changes. The Western hemlock gives way to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the larger-coned Black hemlock; the Douglas spruce
and Lovely fir are replaced by the Noble fir; and
the ragged-barked Alaska cedar greets the eye. Another
thousand feet and the Subalpine fir replaces its
two near relatives. From this point upward, the
forest, now composed only of Black hemlock, Alaska
cedar and Subalpine fir, to which in some places the
White-bark pine must be added, is confined largely to
the crests of ridges and straggles up the mountain in
irregular broken lines. Between these timbered ridges
extensive grassy slopes appear, veritable flower gardens
when in their glory.</p>

<p>At 6,500 feet elevation the timber ceases to be.
Scraggly prostrate firs and hemlocks, sprawling as it
were on the earth for shelter, mark sharply the limit
of their endurance. Here, too, the continuous carpet
of grass and flowers ceases&mdash;and a soil of volcanic
sand or powdered pumice supports a very different
vegetation. At 10,000 feet the toughest mountaineer
of all the flowering plants, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Smelowskia ovalis</i>, still
appears. Far above this, however, even to the crater's
rim, lichens trace their hieroglyphics on the rocks;
and on the steam-warmed rocks of the crater two
mosses find lodgment, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypnum elegans</i> Hooker?, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Philonotis fontana</i> Bridel, the latter even in fruit.</p>

<p>Few plants grow in the dense shades of the lower
forests, and these are mainly ericaceous. Most plentiful
are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">>Vaccinium ovalifolium</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. macrophyllum</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gaultheria ovatifolia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Menziesia ferruginea</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pachystima myrsinites</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cornus canadensis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clintonia uniflora</i>.
Here, too, occur several weird-looking whitish or reddish
saprophytes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monotropa hypopitys</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pterospora andromedea</i>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corallorhiza mertensiana</i>.</p>

<p>On the drier portions of the grassy slopes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lupinus

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
attractive plants. Where the ground is springy <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veratrum
viride</i> occurs in great clumps and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dodecatheon
jeffreyi</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caltha leptosepala</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ranunculus suksdorfii</i>
are plentiful.</p>

<p>In the shelter of the Alpine trees <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhododendron albiflorum</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ribes howellii</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arnica latifolia</i> flourish.
Along the rills <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gentiana calycosa</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arnica chamissonis</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mimulus lewisii</i> form banks of color. On the
cliffs <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chelone nemorosa</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spiraea densiflora</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polemonium
humile</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castilleja rupicola</i> are perhaps most
conspicuous.</p>

<p>Above the limit of trees, in what have been called
"pumice fields," a characteristic series of plants
appears. This belt ranges in altitude from 6,500 to
10,000 feet. It is best developed on the east side
of the mountain, where the avalanches from Little
Tahoma have covered great areas with more or less
finely divided basalt. Conspicuous plants of this
region are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lupinus lyallii</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spraguea multiceps</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polemonium
elegans</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hulsea nana</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erigeron aureus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oreostemma

aureola</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Smelowskia ovalis</i>. The last three ascend
to above Camp Muir, altitude 10,000 feet.</p>

<p>The first botanist to visit Mount Rainier was Dr.
William F. Tolmie, surgeon of the Hudson's Bay Company,
who reached the mountain in 1833. He made
considerable collections, which were sent to Sir William
Hooker. Among Tolmie's plants were several not
previously known.</p>

<p>The writer collected on the mountain in 1888 and
again in 1889 and 1895. Since then the following
botanists have made collections on Mount Rainier:
Rev. E. C. Smith, in 1889 and 1890; Dr. E. L. Greene,
in 1889; Mr. J. B. Flett in 1895, 1896 and since; Mr.
M. W. Gorman in 1897; and Mr. O. D. Allen from 1895
to about 1905.</p>

<p>Most of the work done thus far has been in Paradise
Park and its immediate vicinity. Next to this, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
flora of Spray Park is best known. The east slopes of
the peak have been partially explored, but to the
knowledge of the writer no botanist has ever yet collected
on the west slopes.</p>

<p>The list of plants here given numbers 315 species.
In preparing it, Longmire Springs, altitude 2,850 feet,
has been selected as the lowermost limit on the south
side of the mountain, and Crater Lake, altitude about
3,500 feet, as the limit on the north side. It is quite
certain that a considerable number of lowland plants
will have to be added to the list here given, and it is
possible that a few have been included that will have
to be dropped, as the exact place of collection of some
species is not clearly indicated on the labels of the
specimens. Unless otherwise stated, the notes are
based on the writer's observations and specimens,
and refer mainly to the Paradise Park region.</p>

<p>There yet remains much to be done in the study of
the Mount Rainier flora. A particularly interesting
phase of it lies in the matter of altitudinal distribution
of the various species.</p>

<p>No attempt is here made to list the plants lower than
the ferns. The writer has made considerable collections
of the fungi, liverworts and mosses; and Mr. O. D. Allen
has also collected the mosses. These plants should
receive a larger amount of attention from botanists
who visit the mountain in the future.</p>

<p>The following plants were first described from specimens
obtained on Mount Rainier:</p>

previously known only from the Olympic Mountains.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arnica latifolia</b> Bongard.<br />
A smooth cordate leaved plant with one to five heads, resembling
small sunflowers. Not uncommon up to 6,000 feet altitude, especially
in the shelter of timber.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arnica mollis</b> Hooker.<br />
Similar to the preceding, but the leaves oblong, nearly entire,
and viscid glandular. Abundant along the rivulets, 4,000 to
6,000 feet altitude.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arnica aspera</b> Greene.<br />
Described from specimens collected in Spray Park. It is very
similar to <i>A. mollis</i> Hooker, but the pubescence is coarser.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arnica eradiata</b> (Gray) Heller.<br />
Closely related to the preceding but easily recognized by its
rayless heads. It occurs on the steep slopes above Sluiskin Falls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Luina hypoleuca</b> Bentham.<br />
A beautiful suffruticose plant, six to twelve inches high, with
entire oval leaves shining green above and white tomentose beneath.
It was originally discovered by Dr. Lyall, of the International
Boundary Survey, in the Cascade Mountains at the
49th parallel. It is not uncommon about Mount Rainier, occurring
on perpendicular cliffs along the Cowlitz Glacier; in similar
places on the banks of the Nisqually at Longmire Springs; and
on the gravel bars of the same river. The flowers are cream-colored.</p>

<p class="hang">
<b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rainiera stricta</b> Greene.<br />
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prenanthes stricta</i> Greene.)<br />
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Luina piperi</i> Robinson.)<br />
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Luina stricta</i> Robinson.)<br />
A tall plant with large oblong entire leaves and a long raceme of
yellowish, rayless heads. Professor Greene makes it the type of a
new genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rainiera</i>, while Dr. Robinson refers it to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Luina</i>. The
plant has been collected in Spray Park by Professor Greene;
on the Goat Mountains, Allen; near Mount Adams, Henderson;
head of Naches River, Vasey; and on the high ridge northeast of
the foot of Cowlitz Glacier by the writer. The statement that the
plant has milky juice is an error.</p>

<p class="hang">
<b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Petasites speciosa</b> (Nuttall) Piper.<br />
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nardosmia speciosa</i> Nuttall.)<br />
Abundant along streams up to 3,000 feet altitude. Easily
recognized by its large palmate leaves, which frequently measure
a foot or more in diameter. The flowers appear very early in
spring with the leaves and have an odor suggesting violets. This
species is clearly distinct from the Eastern <i>P. palmata</i> (Aiton) Gray
and was long ago well characterized by Nuttall.</p>

<p class="hang">
<b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Petasites frigida</b> (Linnaeus) Fries.<br />
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Petasites nivalis</i> Greene).<br />
Common along rivulets 4,000 to 5,000 feet altitude. Resembling
the preceding species, but much smaller and with quite
different leaves.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Achillea lanulosa</b> Nuttall.<br />
An Alpine form of the common Western yarrow. Not rare
in the decayed lava at 6,000 to 7,000 feet altitude.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hulsea nana</b> Gray.<br />
A sticky plant with pinnatifid leaves and large yellow heads.
Plentiful on the east side of the mountain near the base of Little
Tahoma in the pumice fields. This seems to be the northernmost
limit of the plant.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anaphalis margaritacea occidentalis</b> Greene.<br />
The well-known "Everlasting Flower," which occurs in dry or
burnt woods up to 4,000 feet altitude.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antennaria media</b> Greene.<br />
A small depressed cudweed, only an inch or two high. Common
at 6,000 feet altitude.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antennaria lanata</b> (Hooker) Greene.<br />
Like the preceding but larger and more hairy. Grassy slopes
at 6,000 feet. Common.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antennaria racemosa</b> Hooker.<br />
Collected by Allen in the "upper valley of the Nisqually."
A much larger and greener plant than the preceding species.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erigeron salsuginosus</b> (Richardson) Gray.<br />
The common pink aster or "daisy" of the grassy slopes. One
of the most conspicuous plants at 4,000 to 6,000 feet altitude,
but even ascending to 7,000 feet in a much dwarfed form.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erigeron acris debilis</b> Gray.<br />
An insignificant white-flowered species, rare at about 7,500 feet
altitude.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erigeron compositus trifidus</b> (Hooker) Gray.<br />
A small pinkish aster, with the leaves cut into linear lobes.
Growing in decayed lava at 7,500 feet altitude.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erigeron speciosus</b> De Candolle.<br />
A handsome species with entire ciliate leaves and rather numerous
heads, with deep violet rays. Collected by Allen in the Goat
Mountains, No. 222.</p>

<p class="hang">
<b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erigeron aureus</b> Greene.<br />
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aplopappus brandegei</i> Gray.)<br />
A beautiful little aster with bright golden rays, the solitary heads
on scapes two or three inches tall. Abundant in the pumice,
7,500-8,000 feet altitude.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aster ledophyllus</b> Gray.<br />
A tall species with leafy stems, and numerous middle-sized
heads with pink-purple rays. The leaves are entire, pubescent
on the under side. Not uncommon on the grassy slopes at 5,000
feet altitude.</p>

<p class="hang">
<b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aster foliaceus frondeus</b> Gray.<br />
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aster amplifolius</i> Greene.)<br />
A species with broad half-clasping leaves and deep-violet-colored
rays. Professor Greene's type came from Mount Rainier,
but his species seems not to differ from the plant earlier described
by Dr. Gray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang">
<b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oreostemma alpigena</b> (Torrey &amp; Gray) Greene.<br />
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aster pulchellus</i> D. C. Eaton.)<br />
A low plant with narrow tufted leaves, the scapes bearing one
or rarely two large heads. The rays are deep violet. The plant
is common in the pumice fields at 7,000-8,000 feet altitude, but,
strange to say, also occurs on the borders of small lakes at the
foot of Pinnacle Peak at 4,500 feet elevation. In exposed places
at high altitudes the leaves are often curiously twisted. It was
originally described from the specimen collected on Mount Rainier
by Tolmie.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Solidago algida</b> Piper.<br />
A small goldenrod, two to twelve inches tall, occurring ordinarily
on the faces of perpendicular cliffs at 5,000 to 6,000 feet elevation.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Artemisia borealis wormskioldii</b> Besser.<br />
A silky canescent wormwood about one foot high, its leaves
pinnate; found on the north side of the mountain by Flett.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Artemisia richardsoniana</b> Besser.<br />
In the Synoptical Flora, Vol. II, p. 371, this species is stated
to have been collected on Mount Rainier by Tolmie. On the
sheet in the Gray Herbarium Dr. Gray has indicated that this is
an error, the specimens having really been collected in the Rocky
Mountains by Burke.</p>


<p><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">CAMPANULACEAE.</b> (Bellflower Family.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campanula rotundifolia</b> Linnaeus.<br />
This charming and familiar blue bell is abundant on the cliffs
near the foot of Cowlitz Glacier.</p>


<p><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">VALERIANACEAE.</b> (Valerian Family.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Valeriana sitchensis</b> Bongard.<br />
An abundant plant at 4,000 to 6,000 feet altitude. The leaves
are pinnately compound, the rather large leaflets repandly dentate.
The flowers are whitish, usually pink tinged. Like other
species, this valerian has a decidedly unpleasant odor, that is
difficult to compare with any other. To the writer the odor is
always associated with mountain meadows, doubtless because it
so frequently predominates in such places.</p>


<p><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">RUBIACEAE.</b> (Madder Family.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Galium triflorum</b> Michaux.<br />
A very common species of bedstraw which ascends on the lower
slopes of the mountain.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Galium oreganum</b> Britton.<br />
Goat Mountains, Allen, No. 296.</p>


<p><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">SCROPHULARIACEAE.</b> (Figwort Family.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chelone nemorosa</b> Douglas.<br />
A handsome plant with opposite serrate leaves and corymbs of
purple-red flowers somewhat like those of the foxglove. Dry
cliffs and slopes at 5,000 feet altitude. Also reported by Gorman
as occurring at Longmire Springs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentstemon confertus</b> Douglas.<br />
A species with entire leaves and dense clusters of small pale
yellow flowers. In its typical form the species is one to two
feet tall, but on Mount Rainier, where it occurs at from 7,000 to
8,000 feet elevation, it is reduced to two to four inches high, but
otherwise not differing from the type.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentstemon procerus</b> Douglas.<br />
Like the above, but blue flowered. It occurs at 8,000 feet and
on Rainier is scarcely two inches tall, while at lower altitudes it
is frequently as many feet high. This dwarf Alpine form has
been described by Professor Greene as a new species under the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentstemon pulchellus</i>. It is an interesting fact that
Tolmie long ago collected on Mount Rainier a dwarf species which
Hooker named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentstemon tolmiei</i>. But alas, the specimens are
in fruit, and it is past finding out now whether his plant was the
yellow-flowered or the blue-flowered form. Most likely, however,
it was the latter, as that is far more frequent than the yellow-flowered
form.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentstemon diffusus</b> Douglas.<br />
A handsome species with serrate leaves and blue-purple flowers.
Mount Rainier, Piper 2068. Goat Mountains, Allen 129.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentstemon ovatus</b> Douglas.<br />
Much like the preceding plant, differing essentially in the
anthers. Collected by Allen "mountains near the upper valley
of the Nisqually," and by the writer on the slopes of Mount
Rainier.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentstemon menziesii</b> Hooker.<br />
A dwarf prostrate plant with thickish evergreen toothed leaves
and dull purple flowers, abundant on the rocks at 8,000 feet
elevation. A variety with the leaves entire instead of denticulate,
<i>P. davidsonii</i> Greene, also occurs on the mountain.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentstemon rupicola</b> (Piper) Howell.<br />
Much like the preceding, but with glaucous leaves and rose-colored
larger flowers. The writer found it originally on the
perpendicular cliffs, at the limit of trees above "Camp of the
Clouds."</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Collinsia tenella</b> (Pursh) Piper.<br />
Collected by Flett on an old moraine along the Carbon Glacier.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mimulus lewisii</b> Pursh.<br />
Abundant along rills, 4,000 to 5,000 feet altitude. Easily
known by its opposite dentate leaves, viscid pubescence and rose-purple
corollas. The original specimens were collected in Idaho
by the Lewis and Clark expedition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang">
<b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mimulus breweri</b> (Greene) Rydberg.<br />
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eunanus breweri</i> Greene.)<br />
A minute species with pale purple flowers, abundant on dry

<p class="hang">
<b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mimulus alpinus</b> (Gray) Piper.<br />
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. luteus alpinus</i> Gray.)<br />
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. scouleri caespitosus</i> Greene.)<br />
A dwarf plant with matted stolons, the bright yellow flowers
painting the cliffs wherever there is dripping water. The Mount
Rainier plants match closely the original types collected by Dr.
Parry in Wyoming, so that Professor Greene's name is clearly a
synonym of the earlier one of Gray.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veronica alpina</b> Linnaeus.<br />
A small plant two or three inches high, with several pairs of
small, ovate, pubescent leaves, and a terminal raceme of small blue
flowers. Common at 4,500 to 5,500 feet altitude.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veronica cusickii</b> Gray.<br />
A very similar plant to the above, but with larger blue flowers
and smooth leaves. Abundant just above "Camp of the Clouds."</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veronica allenii</b> Greenman.<br />
Much like the preceding species, but with smaller white flowers.
A new species discovered by Allen "near Paradise River at 5,400
feet elevation."</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castilleja miniata</b> Douglas.<br />
This vivid scarlet "Painted Cup" or "Indian Pink" is easily
known by its entire leaves. Not infrequent at 5,000 to 6,000 feet;
also occurring at lower altitudes down to sea-level.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castilleja angustifolia hispida</b> (Bentham) Fernald.<br />
Very similar to the last, but the flower spikes shorter and the
leaves cut-lobed. Bear Prairie, Allen.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castilleja rupicola</b> Piper.<br />
Like the last, but smaller, the leaves usually purplish and deeply
cut, the flowers intensely scarlet and with very long beaks. On
the cliffs on both sides of Sluiskin Falls, whence the original specimens
were obtained.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castilleja oreopola</b> Greenman.<br />
The common species of the grassy slopes, the flowers reddish-purple
or occasionally white.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pedicularis bracteosa</b> Bentham.<br />
A tall "lousewort," with fern-like leaves and a long terminal
spike of greenish-white flowers. Frequent in wet places up to

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pedicularis contorta</b> Douglas.<br />
A yellow-flowered species not rare at 7,000 feet elevation along
the Nisqually Glacier. First found by Tolmie on Mount Rainier.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pedicularis surrecta</b> Bentham.<br />
The reddish flowers with long, coiled beaks easily distinguish
this plant. Common in wet meadows at 4,000 feet altitude.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pedicularis ornithorhyncha</b> Bentham.<br />
Much like the preceding but with beakless flowers. Originally
described from Mount Rainier specimens collected by Tolmie in
1833, and not again seen until the writer collected them in the same
place in 1888. The plant has since been found at two or three
places north of Mount Rainier, but all in Washington.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pedicularis racemosa</b> Douglas.<br />
The commonest species, easily known by its half prostrate habit,
lanceolate leaves, and short clusters of white or pinkish twisted
flowers. Ranges from 3,000 to 5,000 feet elevation.</p>


<p><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">PINGUICULACEAE.</b> (Butterwort Family.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinguicula vulgaris</b> Linnaeus.<br />
The butterwort, with its greasy entire leaves in a rosette and

<p><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">LABIATAE.</b> (Mint Family.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Madronella discolor</b> Greene.<br />
A very sweet-smelling plant, the only mint as yet found on the

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abies amabilis</b> (Douglas) Forbes. Lovely Fir.<br />
The Lovely fir is abundant at from 2,500 to 3,500 feet elevation.
It is usually but a small tree, with beautifully symmetrical form.
Except when fruiting, it is difficult to distinguish from the lowland
white fir.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abies nobilis</b> Lindley. Noble Fir.<br />
The finest of all the firs, frequently four to six feet in diameter,
without a single branch for a hundred feet or more. Easily
known by the deep red color of the bark when chopped into, and by
the large cones, covered with reflexed bracts. Abundant at 4,000

The Black hemlock is frequent from 4,000 to 6,000 feet elevation.
On the higher slopes it commonly forms clumps with the Subalpine
fir. When this is the case, the irregular form and dark foliage of the
hemlock, usually festooned with lichens, form a pleasing contrast
to the conical form and lighter foliage of the fir.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinus albicaulis</b> Engelmann. White-bark Pine.<br />
This white-barked nut pine is abundant on the high ridge north
of the Cowlitz Glacier. It also occurs above Camp of the Clouds.
It rarely fruits, and when it does the cones, with their sweet edible
seeds, are quickly torn to pieces by Clark's crow. The trunk and
branches are frequently adorned with the bright yellow lichen,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Evernia vulpina</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><b lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinus monticola</b> Douglas. Western White Pine.<br />

>XVII. CREATION OF MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK<br />

<small>MEMORIAL BY SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES</small></h2>

<blockquote><p class="hang">A surprisingly wide interest was awakened by the proposal to
create a national park to include the great mass of Mount
Rainier and its immediate surroundings. Five societies appointed
committees to coöperate in securing the needed legislation
from Congress. Those committees prepared a memorial.
The Senate Miscellaneous Document, number 247, Fifty-third
Congress, second session, shows that the memorial was introduced
on July 16, 1894, by Senator Watson C. Squire from the
State of Washington. The memorial was deemed of sufficient
importance to be republished in the Eighteenth Annual Report
of the United States Geological Survey for 1896-1897. It is
here reproduced from that publication.</p>

<p class="hang">With all the interest thus manifested, it required nearly five years
from the introduction of the memorial to witness the achievement
of its purpose. The act of Congress creating the Mount
Rainier National Park bears the date of March 2, 1899.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">
<i>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled:</i></p>

<p>At a meeting of the Geological Society of America,
in Madison, Wis., August 15, 1893, a committee was
appointed for the purpose of memorializing the Congress
in relation to the establishment of a national park
in the State of Washington to include Mount Rainier,
often called Mount Tacoma. The committee consists
of Dr. David T. Day, Mr. S. F. Emmons, and Mr.
Bailey Willis.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, in Madison, Wis., August
21, 1893, a committee was appointed by that body for
the same purpose as above mentioned, consisting of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Maj. J. W. Powell, Prof. Joseph Le Conte, Prof.
I. C. Russell, Mr. B. E. Fernow, and Dr. C. H. Merriam.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the National Geographic Society,
held in Washington, D. C., on October 13, 1893, there
was appointed a committee for the purpose above
mentioned, consisting of Hon. Gardiner G. Hubbard,
Hon. Watson C. Squire, Mr. John W. Thompson,
Miss Mary F. Waite, and Miss Eliza R. Scidmore.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Sierra Club, held in San Francisco
December 30, 1893, a committee for the same purpose
was appointed, composed of Mr. John Muir, President
D. S. Jordan, Mr. R. M. Johnson, Mr. George B.
Bayley, Mr. P. B. Van Trump.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Appalachian Mountain Club,
held in Boston April 11, 1894, a similar committee was
appointed, consisting of Mr. John Ritchie, Jr., Rev.
E. C. Smith, Dr. Charles E. Fay.</p>

<p>The committees thus appointed were instructed by
the several bodies to which they belong to coöperate
in the preparation of a memorial to Congress, setting
forth the substantial reasons for the establishment of
such park.</p>

<p>Pursuant to their instructions, the committees present
the following memorial to the Congress, and pray
that such action may be taken by the honorable Senators
and Representatives as will secure to the people
of the United States the benefits of a national park
which shall include the area mentioned above. In
support of their prayer they beg to submit the following
statement:</p>

<p>By proclamation of the President, in compliance with
the statutes provided therefor, a Pacific Forest Reserve
has been established in the State of Washington,
the western portion of which is nearly coincident with
the tract of land to be included in the national park
for which your memorialists pray.</p>

<p>The western part of this reserve includes many features
of unique interest and wonderful grandeur, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
fit it peculiarly to be a national park, forever set aside
for the pleasure and instruction of the people. The
region is one of such exceptional rainfall and snowfall
that the preservation of its forests is of unusual importance
as a protection against floods in the lower
valleys; but the scenic features, which mark it out
for a national park, attract tourists, who set fire to
the timber. This destruction goes on notwithstanding
it is a forest reserve, and will continue until protection
is afforded by adequate supervision of the area, whether
as a reserve or park.</p>

<p>The reserve is traversed through the middle from
north to south by the crest of the Cascade Range, which
has an elevation varying from 5,300 to 6,800 feet. This
is the divide between tributaries of Puget Sound,
flowing west, and those of Yakima River, flowing east.
Mount Rainier, the isolated volcanic peak, 14,400 feet
high, stands 12 miles west of the divide, from which it is
separated by a deep valley.</p>

<p>The eastern half of the reserve differs from the
western in climate, in flora, and in fauna, in geographic
and geologic features, and in aspects of scenery. The
eastern slope of the Cascade Range within the reserve
is a mountainous region, with summits rising to a
general elevation of 6,500 to 7,600 feet above the sea.
It is forest covered and presents many attractions to
the tourist and hunter; but it is not peculiar among
the mountain regions of America either for grandeur
or interest, and it is not an essential part of the area
to be set apart as a national park.</p>

<p>The western slope of the Cascades within the reserve
is short and steep as compared with the eastern. Much
of it is precipitous, particularly opposite Mount
Rainier, where its bare walls would appear most grand
were they not in the shadow of that overpowering
peak. North and south of Rainier this slope is more
gradual and densely wooded.</p>

<p>The western half of the Pacific reserve, that portion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
which it is proposed shall be made a national park,
is characterized by Mount Rainier, whose summit is
but 4 miles from the western boundary of the reserve
and whose glaciers extend beyond its limits.</p>

<p>Mount Tacoma is not simply a volcanic cone, peculiar
for its hugeness. It was formerly a vast volcanic dome,
30 miles in radius to the north, west, and south; but
rivers have cut deep canyons, glaciers have carved
ample amphitheaters back into the mass, and now many
serrate ridges rising from a few hundred to 10,000 feet
above the sea converge at that altitude to support
the central pyramid, which towers more than 4,000
feet above its base.</p>

<p>This grand mountain is not, like Mount Blanc, merely
the dominant peak of a chain of snow mountains; it
is the only snow peak in view, Mount St. Helens and
Mount Adams being, like it, isolated and many miles
distant. Rainier is majestic in its isolation, reaching
6,000 to 8,000 feet above its neighbors. It is superb
in its boldness, rising from one canyon 11,000 feet in 7
miles. Not only is it the grandest mountain in this
country, it is one of the grand mountains of the world,
to be named with St. Elias, Fusiyama, and Ararat, and
the most superb summits of the Alps. Eminent scientists
of England and Germany, who, as members of
the Alpine Club of Switzerland and travelers of wide
experience, would naturally be conservative in their
judgment, have borne witness to the majesty of the
scenery about Rainier.</p>

<p>In 1883 Professor Zittel, a well-known German geologist,
and Prof. James Bryce, member of Parliament
and author of the American Commonwealth, made a
report on the scenery about Mount Rainier. Among
other things, they said:</p>

<p>"The scenery of Mount Rainier is of rare and varied
beauty. The peak itself is as noble a mountain as
we have ever seen in its lines and structure. The
glaciers which descend from its snow fields present all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the characteristic features of those in the Alps, and
though less extensive than the ice streams of the Mount
Blanc or Monta Rosa groups are in their crevasses and
séracs equally striking and equally worthy of close
study. We have seen nothing more beautiful in
Switzerland or Tyrol, in Norway or in the Pyrenees,
than the Carbon River glaciers and the great Puyallup
glaciers; indeed, the ice in the latter is unusually pure,
and the crevasses unusually fine. The combination of
ice scenery with woodland scenery of the grandest
type is to be found nowhere in the Old World, unless it
be in the Himalayas, and, so far as we know, nowhere
else on the American Continent."</p>

<p>These eminent and experienced observers further
say:</p>

<p>"We may perhaps be permitted to express a hope
that the suggestion will at no distant date be made to
Congress that Mount Rainier should, like the Yosemite
Valley and the geyser region of the Upper Yellowstone,
be reserved by the Federal Government and treated
as a national park."</p>

<p>But Mount Tacoma is single not merely because it is
superbly majestic; it is an arctic island in a temperate
zone. In a bygone age an arctic climate prevailed over
the Northwest, and glaciers covered the Cascade Range.
Arctic animals and arctic plants then lived throughout
the region. As the climate became milder and glaciers
melted, the creatures of the cold climate were limited
in their geographic range to the districts of the shrinking
glaciers. On the great peak the glaciers linger still.
They give to it its greatest beauty. They are themselves
magnificent, and with them survives a colony of
arctic animals and plants which can not exist in the
temperate climate of the less lofty mountains. These
arctic forms are as effectually isolated as shipwrecked
sailors on an island in mid-ocean. There is no refuge
for them beyond their haunts on ice-bound cliffs.
But even there the birds and animals are no longer safe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
from the keen sportsman, and the few survivors must
soon be exterminated unless protected by the Government
in a national park.</p>

<p>The area of the Pacific forest reserve includes valuable
timber and important water supplies. It is said to
contain coal, gold, and silver.</p>

<p>The timber on the western slope differs from that on
the eastern in size and density of growth and in kinds of
trees. The forests of Puget Sound are world-renowned
for the magnitude and beauty of their hemlocks, cedars,
and firs. Their timber constitutes one of the most important
resources of the State. Nowhere are they more
luxuriant than on the foothills west and north of Mount
Rainier. But their value as timber is there subordinate
to their value as regulators of floods. The Puyallup
River, whose lower valley is a rich hop garden, is even
now subject to floods during the rapid melting of the
snow on Mount Rainier in the limited area above timber
line. In the broader area below timber line, but above
3,000 feet in elevation, the depth of snow in the winter
of 1893 was 9 to 15 feet. Protected by the dense
canopy of the fir and hemlock trees this snow melts
slowly and the river is high from March to June. But
let the forest be once destroyed by fire or by lumbermen
and the snows of each winter, melting in early spring,
will annually overwhelm the Puyallup Valley and transform
it into a gravelly waste. The same is true of
White River and the Nisqually.</p>

<p>The forests of the eastern slope, tributary to the
Yakima, are of even greater importance as water
preservers. They constitute a great reservoir, holding
back the precipitation of the wet season and allowing
it to filter down when most needed by crops. In the
Yakima Valley water gives to land its value. Storage
of flood waters and extensive distribution by canals
is necessary. The forests being preserved to control
the water, the natural storage basins should be improved
and canals built. For these reasons it is most important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
that no part of the forest reserve should be sacrificed,
even though the eastern half is not included in the
national park.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the proposed national park have
been so drawn as to exclude from its area all lands upon
which coal, gold, or other valuable minerals are supposed
to occur, and they conform to the purpose that the
park shall include all features of peculiar scenic beauty
without encroaching on the interests of miners or
settlers.</p>

<p>None save those who can march and camp in the
primeval forest can now visit Mount Rainier; but it
is the wilderness, not the distance, that makes it difficult
of approach. On the west the distance up the
Nisqually River from the railroad at Yelm Prairie to
the reserve is but 40 miles. Though heavily timbered,
the valley of the Nisqually affords an easy route for a
railroad. The Cowlitz Valley also offers a line of
approach without difficulty by rail, it being about 50
miles from the railroad to the reserve.</p>

<p>On the northwest the railroad at Wilkeson is but 23
miles from the summit of Mount Rainier, and the
glaciers can be reached by riding 25 miles through the
great forest.</p>

<p>On the north the Cascade branch of the Northern
Pacific Railroad crosses the range, only 13 miles in a
direct line and 19 miles along the summit from the
northern limit of the reserve.</p>

<p>On the east the city of North Yakima is but 62 miles
from the summit of Mount Rainier.</p>

<p>The proposed park covers a mountain region which
lies across the line of travel from east to west. The
railroad winds northward; the travel down the Columbia
River turns southward to avoid it. The great
current of tourists which flows north and south through
Portland, Tacoma, Seattle, Vancouver, and Alaska
passes to the west within sight of Mount Rainier,
and when the grand old mountain is obscured by clouds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the travelers linger to see it, or, passing regretfully on
their way, know that they have missed the finest view
of their trip.</p>

<p>When a railroad is built up the Nisqually or Cowlitz
Valley to the park and connection by stages is assured
northward to the Cascade branch of the Northern
Pacific Railroad and eastward to Yakima, the flood
of travel will be diverted through the park.</p>

<p>The point which combines accessibility with surroundings
of great beauty, and which is therefore most
appropriate as a hotel site, is southeast of Mount
Rainier, on one of the spurs of the Tatoosh Mountains,
near the Cowlitz Valley. To open this region to
travel it would be sufficient to establish the hotel and
its connections down the Nisqually or Cowlitz Valley,
together with trails to points of interest within the park.
From the hotel a principal trail would extend north to
the Emmons and White River glaciers, which would
thus be easily accessible, and thence the railroad at
Wilkeson could readily be reached on horseback over
the old Northern Pacific trail. In the future, stage
roads, or possibly a railroad, would be extended over the
Cowlitz Pass to the eastern slope, North Yakima would
be reached via the Tieton or Tannum Valley, and Tannum
Lake would become a favorite resort.</p>

<p>But the highway which would challenge the world
for its equal in grand scenery would extend from the
Cowlitz Pass northward along the crest of the range to
the Cascade branch. The distance is 50 miles, 31 in
the park and 19 beyond it to the railroad. Within the
reserve the summit is open and park-like. On the east
is a sea of mountains; on the west is a bold descent
of 3,000 feet to the valleys of Cowlitz and White rivers,
beyond which Tacoma rises in overpowering grandeur,
8,000 feet above the road and only 12 miles distant.</p>

<p>A committee of your memorialists has carefully
examined the existing maps of the State of Washington
with special reference to the position of this reserve,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and finds that the boundaries of the reserve are farther
east, in relation to Mount Rainier, than was supposed.
The western boundary traverses the slope of Mount
Rainier at altitudes of 7,000 to 9,000 feet, and the
glaciers extend several miles beyond it. In order to
include all of the glacial area and the immediately
adjacent forest on the west, your memorialists respectfully
recommend that the western boundary of the park
be drawn one range west of that of the reserve, viz.,
at the range line between ranges 6 and 7 east of the
Willamette meridian. By this change no part of the
Wilkeson-Carbonado coal field would be included in the
park.</p>

<p>Your memorialists find, as already stated, that it is
not necessary to include the eastern slope of the Cascades
in the park, and furthermore that it is desirable
to leave the Natchez Pass on the north and the Cowlitz
Pass on the south open for the construction of railroads.
Your memorialists therefore pray that the park be
defined by the following boundaries: Beginning at
the northwest corner of sec. 19, T. 18 N., R. 7 E. of the
Willamette meridian; thence south 24 miles more or
less to the southwest corner of sec. 18, T. 14 N., R. 7
E.; thence east 27 miles more or less to the summit of
the Cascade Range; thence in a northerly direction to a
point east of the place of beginning, and thence west
26 miles more or less to the place of beginning.</p>

<p>Your memorialists respectfully represent that&mdash;</p>

<p>Railroad lines have been surveyed and after the establishment
of a national park would soon be built to
its boundaries. The concessions for a hotel, stopping
places, and stage routes could be leased and the proceeds
devoted to the maintenance of the park. The
policing of the park could be performed from the barracks
at Vancouver by details of soldiers, who would
thus be given useful and healthful employment from
May to October.</p>

<p>The establishment of a hotel would afford opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
for a weather station, which, in view of the
controlling influence exerted by Mount Rainier on the
moisture-laden winds from the Pacific, would be important
in relation to local weather predictions.</p>

<p>Your memorialists further represent that this region
of marvelous beauty is even now being seriously marred
by careless camping parties. Its valuable forests and
rare animals are being injured and will certainly be
destroyed unless the forest reserve be policed during
the camping seasons. But efficient protection of the
undeveloped wilderness is extraordinarily difficult and
in this case practically impossible.</p>

<p>Therefore, for the preservation of the property of
the United States, for the protection from floods of the
people of Washington in the Yakima, Cowlitz, Nisqually,
Puyallup, and White River valleys, and for the
pleasure and education of the nation, your memorialists
pray that the area above described be declared a
national park forever.</p>

XVIII. MOUNT RAINIER IS 14,408 FEET HIGH<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By</span> THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY</small></h2>

<blockquote><p class="hang">The United States Geological Survey issued a bulletin for newspaper
publication on January 22, 1914, giving the height
of the mountain as determined by the most accurate and definitive
methods known. That bulletin is here given as it was
then issued. At the same time F. E. Matthes, topographer
with the Survey, sent additional comment to the Sierra Club
of California, by whom it was published in the Sierra Bulletin
for January, 1914. This comment is now reproduced by permission
of the Sierra Club.</p></blockquote>


<p>The height of the summit of Mount Rainier, Washington,
has been determined by the United States
Geological Survey to be 14,408 feet above mean sea
level. This elevation now officially displaces the former
supposed height of the mountain of 14,363 feet
and accords to Mount Rainier the distinction of being
the second highest mountain peak in the United States,
Mount Whitney, California, being the highest. The
correct height of Rainier was determined by a party
of topographic engineers of the Survey in connection
with the mapping of the Mount Rainier National Park,
which was completed last summer. The topographic
survey of the park was begun in 1910 by F. E. Matthes,
continued in 1911 by Mr. Matthes and George R.
Davis, and finished in 1913 by C. H. Birdseye, W. O.
Tufts, O. G. Taylor, and S. E. Taylor.</p>

<p>In the mapping of the summit of the mountain a
terrific blizzard was encountered; in fact, two ascents
of the upper portion of the mountain were necessary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
The first ascent of the upper 5,450 feet was begun at
5 o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, August 16 [1913], and dawn broke with
every indication of developing into a beautiful day. On
reaching the summit the men encountered a terrific
gale, clouds enveloped the mountain, preventing observations,
and by noon snow began to fall. A descent
was attempted, but the party became hopelessly lost
in a labyrinth of crevasses, the storm developing into
a blizzard. To descend further was impossible; to
remain was suicide. Consequently a return to the
crater was ordered, and the men reached it after a
two hours' climb, utterly exhausted and nearly frozen.
Here they sought shelter in one of the steam caves,
where during the long night they were thoroughly
steamed and half frozen in turn. Strenuous measures
were employed by the men to keep from falling asleep
and freezing to death. As it was, their fingers and
ears were badly frozen. Finally, with a rising barometer,
they succeeded in descending 9,000 feet to a temporary
camp, making the descent in three hours. Here
they recuperated and prepared for another ascent,
which was accomplished on August 20, the start being
made at 1 o'clock in the morning. Good weather was
encountered and the mapping of the entire summit was
finished by 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>"If anyone thinks that American glaciers are play
glaciers, or that the weather which may be encountered
at the summit of Mount Rainier in August is uniformly
balmy and springlike," said Mr. Birdseye, whose
fingers and ears were badly frosted, "let him climb
Mount Rainier during one of its summer blizzards.
The steam caves in the crater are not the pleasantest
places imaginable to spend the night in, but had they
not been there, not one of us would be alive today to
tell the tale."

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Comment by F. E. Matthes</span></p>

<p>The mountaineers of the Pacific Northwest will no
doubt jubilate at the above announcement by the
United States Geological Survey of the new figure for
the altitude of Mount Rainier. It places that peak
close to the top of the list of high mountains in the
United States. Mount Rainier's closest rival on the
Pacific coast, Mount Shasta, it so happens, has just
recently been beheaded by the United States Coast
and Geodetic Survey, and now can claim no more than
14,162 feet, that is, 218 feet less than it once boasted.
The great volcano of Puget Sound is thus left well in
the lead.</p>

<p>A review of the different figures that have been
announced in the past for each of the higher peaks of
the United States would almost justify one to infer
that these summits have a peculiar habit of fluctuating
in height from time to time. Both Rainier and Shasta
have been notorious for their inconstancy; so much so
indeed that it is to be feared that the public will lose
faith somewhat in the trustworthiness of altitude
determinations in general. There is good reason to
believe, however, that the last announcements for
these two peaks are not likely to be changed again.
About Mount Shasta, perhaps the Coast Survey is the
only party able to speak positively; but as regards
Mount Rainier, the Geological Survey feels satisfied
that the new figure is the best that can be obtained
with modern methods and instruments.</p>

<p>The elevation of Mount Whitney (14,501 ft.), it
may be remembered, was determined by actual leveling,
but such procedure would have been impossible on
Mount Rainier, as the most practicable route to its
summit leads over many miles of snow and ice, and up
a precipitous chute several hundred feet in height.
On thawing snow accurate leveling is out of the question,
for the instrument can not be set up so firmly that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
it will not settle slightly between back and fore sights.
To execute this pottering kind of work in freezing
weather would entail both hardship and great expense.
But the obstacle that would have proved entirely insuperable
to levels on Mount Rainier and led to the
abandoning of that method is the dreaded Gibraltar
Rock, well known to many who read this magazine
[Sierra Club Bulletin]. To carry levels up its precipitous
side is for practical considerations all but impossible.</p>

<p>It was necessary, in the case of Mount Rainier, to
resort to long-distance methods of angulation. That is
to say, sights were taken to its summit from neighboring
peaks, six to eight miles distant, the altitudes of
which had been carefully determined, and the positions
of which with respect to the mountain's summit
had been computed from a scheme of triangulation.</p>

<p>It is not possible to execute vertical-angle measurements
of this sort with the precision obtainable by
leveling; at the same time by providing a sufficient
number of checks and repeating each measurement
many times a result can be attained that can be relied
on within a foot or two. And closer than that the
determination of a snowcapped peak, such as Mount
Rainier, need scarcely be; for its actual height is
bound to fluctuate by several feet from year to year
and even from month to month.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to note how closely the new trigonometric
determination of Mount Rainier accords
with the barometric one of Prof. Alexander McAdie
(14,394 ft.). It is hoped that this agreement between
the results of two fundamentally different methods
will strengthen public faith in their reliability, and lead
to the discarding of other figures (some of them much
exaggerated) that have appeared in print from time to
time.</p>

<p>In closing, it may be said, that the Geological Survey's
bulletin little more than hints at the fortitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and pluck of Mr. Birdseye and his party in their almost
disastrous experiences on the peak. Survey men
are so frequently confronted by peril in their daily
work, that they are not apt to write or talk about it,
and as a consequence the public seldom learns the
intimate details. It is to be hoped that the history of
this undertaking will some day appear in full.</p>

XIX. PLACE NAMES AND ELEVATIONS IN
MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK</h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang">Place names within a region like the Mount Rainier National
Park are produced by three causes: The first and most important
is the actual need of such names by those who work within
the Park and by those who report upon or write about it. The
second is the natural desire to honor those individuals whose
achievements are worthy of commemoration. The third
cause is found in the vanity of visitors. This is sometimes
manifested in the harmless and often helpful desire just to be
the one to name something, but usually it takes the form of a
desire of visitors to write the names of themselves or their
friends upon the map.</p>

<p class="hang">The ranger who discovers from a look-out peak a distant fire
near some unnamed lake or cliff hastens to a telephone, but
finds his work of sending fire fighters to the place of danger
much more difficult than if he could use some definite place
name. Trail builders and patrols continually find a similar
need for names. For their own use they proceed to invent
names which often stick. The Mountaineers in 1915 found
that a trail builder had supplied such a need by giving a beautiful
waterfall near his trail the name of his favorite brand of
canned peaches. More care of such matters is now being exercised
by those interested working through the United States
Geographic Board.</p>

<p class="hang">The elevations given are taken from the official map and other
Government publications. In time all important heights will
be definitely determined and marked.</p>

<p class="hang">It is hoped that this compilation of the names may be improved
from year to year. Further facts about any of the names
would be welcomed by the editor of this work.</p></blockquote>

superb mountain view. Elevation, 5,947 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Camp of the Stars.</b> On the southeastern slope of the mountain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
near the foot of Gibraltar. It is a narrow shelf of rocks, affording
space for a dozen climbers when crowded together and "feet
hanging over." It was used by one of the Ingraham parties, and

of their joy at the first rays of morning. Elevation, about 12,000
feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Canyon Bridge.</b> In the southeastern part of the Park. The
Muddy Fork of the Cowlitz River rushes through a very narrow
and deep rift in the rocks. The spanning bridge gives an attractive
view.</p>

<p><b>Carbon Glacier.</b> This glacier begins at the foot of Willis Wall
on the north face of the mountain.</p>

<p><b>Carbon River.</b> About 1876 coal was discovered on the banks of
this river suggesting the name, which was also later given to the
glacier from which the river has its source.</p>

<p><b>Carter Falls.</b> One of the beautiful features of the lower Paradise
River. Named for an early guide who built the first trail to
Paradise Valley. For years the Longmires collected a fee of fifty
cents from each one using the trail. It was willingly paid when it
was explained that the money went to the builder of the trail.</p>

<p><b>Castle Rock.</b> In the northwestern portion of the Park.
Named from its resemblance to an old castle. Elevation, 6,116
feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Cataract Basin.</b> See Mist Park.</p>

<p><b>Cataract Creek.</b> Flows from Mist Park to the Carbon River in
the northwestern portion of the Park. About midway in its course
are the beautiful Cataract Falls.</p>

<p><b>Cathedral Rocks.</b> Extending southeast from the summit. It
is an extensive cleaver between the upper Cowlitz and Ingraham
Glaciers. Who first suggested the name has not been ascertained.
Elevation, 8,262 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Chenuis Mountain.</b> An extensive ridge near the northern
boundary of the Park. On the shoulders of the mountain rest
three little lakes called Chenuis Lakes. From the northern slopes
of the mountain there rises Chenuis Creek, which, near its junction
with the Carbon River at the northwestern boundary of the Park,
produces the beautiful Chenuis Falls. The name seems to be
Indian, but its origin has not been ascertained. Elevation of the
ridge, from 4,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Christine Falls.</b> On the lower portion of Van Trump creek.
Mr. Van Trump says the falls "were named after my daughter,
Christine Louise, by a friend John Hayes, of Yelm." Elevation,
3,667 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Cliff Lake.</b> In the south-central portion of the Park, between
the Tatoosh Range and the boundary.

<p><b>Clover Lakes.</b> In White River Park, in the northwestern part
of the Park.</p>

<p><b>Cold Basin.</b> In the northern portion of the Park, just south of
Grand Park.</p>

<p><b>Colonnade.</b> The ridge lying between the South Mowich
and the Puyallup Glaciers on the west-central slope of the mountain.</p>

<p><b>Columbia Crest.</b> Name suggested by H. E. Holmes of the
Ingraham party in 1891. They had spent two nights in the crater
and before leaving voted on a name for the highest part of the
summit, with Columbia Crest as the result. It has occasionally
been called The Dome. By Stevens and Van Trump it was called
Crater Peak. Elevation, 14,408 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Comet Falls.</b> On the southern slope of the mountain, in Van
Trump Park. Elevation, 5,200 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Cougar Falls.</b> Near the southern boundary of the Park, in the
Nickel Creek tributary of the Cowlitz River.</p>

<p><b>Cowlitz Chimneys.</b> Pointed and columnar rocks on the east-central
slope. Though not adjacent to the glacier or river of that
name, they undoubtedly got their name from one or the other.
Elevation 7,607 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Cowlitz Cleaver.</b> Near the southern peak of the summit. It
is appropriately named, as it cleaves the higher streams of ice part
of which flow into Puget Sound and the rest into the Columbia
River.</p>

<p><b>Cowlitz Divide.</b> A ridge running from north to south in the
southeastern corner of the Park.</p>

<p><b>Cowlitz Glacier.</b> Named by General Hazard Stevens and
P. B. Van Trump in 1870 when they discovered it to be the source
of the river by that name. It has its beginning from a group of
smaller glaciers on the southeast slope of the mountain. Above
the glaciers lies Cowlitz Park.</p>

<p><b>Cowlitz River.</b> The name appears as early as the Lewis and
Clark reports, 1805-1806, where it is spelled Coweliskee. In
varying forms it appears in the writings of all subsequent explorers.
A tribe of Indians by that name inhabited its valleys. The river
finally flows southward into the Columbia River.</p>

<p><b>Cowlitz Rocks.</b> A mass of rocks on the southeast slope, between
the Paradise and Cowlitz Glaciers. The rocks were named in
1907 by the veteran guide, Jules Stampfler, who found a name
necessary to satisfy the curiosity of his companies of tourists.
Elevation, 7,457 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Crater Lake.</b> On the northwest slope. Bailey Willis gave the
name in 1883. He recently wrote: "The amphitheatres which
the young geologist mistook for craters are now known to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
glacier basins eroded by ice." Elevation, 4,929 feet above sea
level.</p>

<p><b>Crater Peak.</b> See Columbia Crest.</p>

<p><b>Crescent Mountain.</b> On the northern slope. The name was
used by Bailey Willis in 1883. Near the foot of this mountain lies
Crescent Lake.</p>

<p><b>Cress Falls.</b> In the northwestern portion of the Park, near
Spukwush Creek.</p>

<p><b>Crystal Mountain.</b> On the southwestern slope of the mountain,
overlooking Indian Henrys Hunting Ground. Elevation, 6,300
feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Cushman Crest.</b> On the southern slope, overlooking Nisqually
Glacier. Named in honor of the late Congressman F. W. Cushman,
of Tacoma.</p>

<p><b>Dege Peak.</b> Overlooking Yakima Park in the northern part of
the Park. Origin of name not ascertained.</p>

<p><b>Denman Falls.</b> On the western slope, in St. Andrews Creek.
Named by Ben Longmire in honor of A. H. Denman of Tacoma,
enthusiastic mountaineer and photographer.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
glaciers were visited by Vice President Oakes of the Northern
Pacific Railroad Company and United States Senator George F.
Edmunds of Vermont. One result of that trip was an order to build

dividing the lower parts of the Tahoma and South Tahoma Glaciers.
The name is descriptive, but by whom it was first suggested has
not been ascertained.</p>

<p><b>Emmons Glacier.</b> On the northeastern slope. This is the
largest glacier on the mountain. For a long time it was called
White Glacier because it gave rise to the river of that name. The
river's name came from the glacial whiteness of its waters. The
present name is in honor of S. F. Emmons, who, with A. D. Wilson,
made the second successful ascent of the mountain in 1870.</p>

<p><b>Eunice Lake.</b> In the northwest corner of the Park near Tolmie
Peak. Bailey Willis named it Tolmie Lake in 1883; but it was

the west of Narada Falls.</p>

<p><b>Frozen Lake.</b> In the northern portion of the Park, just south
of Mount Fremont.</p>

<p><b>Fryingpan Glacier.</b> There are two conflicting theories about
this name. One is that some campers lost a frying pan in the river,
giving it that name, which was later extended to the glacier. The
other is that Professor I. C. Russell named the glacier from its
fancied resemblance to a frying pan, and that the name was
later extended to the river. On the east-central slope of the
mountain.</p>

rather steep but attractive little park, with a small lake and good
spring water. Inter Glacier is at its head and Inter Fork passes
through it. Miners at Starbo Camp maintain a little waterpower
sawmill, and they have for years worked at prospective mines on
the slopes of the Basin. They have built a wagon road to their
camp, by use of which tourists will soon become well acquainted
with the beauties of Glacier Basin and the surrounding regions.
Elevation, 6,000 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Glacier Island.</b> On the southwestern slope of the mountain.
The name is descriptive, as the island lies between the lower parts
of Tahoma and South Tahoma Glaciers.</p>

and ornamented with circular groves of alpine firs and hemlocks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
with deer abundant every summer, make the name an appropriate

<p><b>Indian Henrys Hunting Ground.</b> About 1870, a Cowlitz Indian
began hunting mountain goats in that region. Henry Winsor, a
pioneer mail carrier, asked his name and got an unpronounceable
answer. "That's no name," said Winsor, "your name is Indian
Henry." His playful joke stuck. On the map the word "Indian"
is omitted, but the United States Geographic Board has voted
to restore it. P. B. Van Trump said the Indian's name was
Sotolick.</p>

<p><b>Ingraham Glacier.</b> This beautiful glacier lies between Cathedral
Rocks and Little Tahoma on the southeast slope. It was
named by Professor I. C. Russell in 1896 in honor of Major E. S.
Ingraham of Seattle.</p>

<p><b>Inter Glacier.</b> On the northeast slope. It was named by
Major E. S. Ingraham in 1886 when he attempted but failed to
ascend the mountain from the north side. The name was suggested
by the glacier being hemmed in by a rim of rocks.</p>

<p><b>Ipsut Pass.</b> In the northwestern corner of the Park. Flowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
from it to the Carbon River is a stream called Ipsut Creek. The
word is said to be a form of an Indian word meaning "bear."</p>

named Lake O. D. Allen. The name was given in honor of the
veteran botanist, who was at one time a professor at Yale University.</p>

<p><b>Lake Eleanor.</b> Near the northern boundary of the Park.
Origin of name not ascertained.</p>

<p><b>Lake Ethel.</b> In the north-central portion of the Park, with

<p><b>Lake George.</b> On the western slope of Mount Wow in the
southwestern corner of the Park. Origin of name not ascertained.</p>

<p><b>Lake James.</b> In the north-central portion of the Park, with

portion of the Park. Origin of name not ascertained.</p>

<p><b>Liberty Cap.</b> The northern peak of the summit of Mount
Rainier. It has been claimed that Stevens and Van Trump gave
this name at the time of their first ascent in 1870, but Mr. Van
Trump says they called it Tahoma Peak. One of the early uses
of the present name was by Bailey Willis, who wrote in 1883:
"Over the trees near the outlet, just to the right of this pinnacle, a
pure white peak towers up into the heavens; it is the northern
summit of Mount Tacoma,&mdash;the Liberty Cap." Elevation,
14,112 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Liberty Ridge.</b> To the west of Willis Wall and overlooking the
head of Carbon Glacier near the northern summit. The name was

against the sky by those traveling on the Carbon River
trail. Elevation, 6,540 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Mount Ararat.</b> On the southwest slope, overlooking Indian
Henrys Hunting Ground. Ben Longmire writes: "I named it
because I found there some long slabs of wood that had turned to
stone and I thought they might have been part of old Noah's boat.
I also found a stump with a ring around it as if his rope might have
been tied there. It was all stone." Elevation, 5,996 feet above
sea level.</p>

of this book. Elevation, 14,408 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Mount Ruth.</b> On the northeastern slope of the mountain, overlooking
the Inter and Emmons Glaciers. The name was given
in honor of Ruth Knapp, daughter of the prospector who built
"Knapp's Cabin," a landmark for tourists in the Glacier Basin
region. Elevation, 8,700 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Mount Wow.</b> In the southwestern corner of the Park. It is

feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Mowich Glaciers.</b> On the western and northwestern slopes
of the mountain are two beautiful glaciers known as North and
South Mowich. The name is from the Chinook jargon, meaning
"deer." Who first suggested the name has not been ascertained.
Each glacier has its draining stream. These flow together, making
Mowich River, which crosses the northwestern boundary of the
Park. North Mowich was once called Willis Glacier and South
Mowich was called Edmunds Glacier.</p>

<p><b>Muddy Fork.</b> On the southeastern slope of the mountain.
One of several sources of the Cowlitz River, it drains from the foot
of the large Cowlitz Glacier.</p>

<p><b>Myrtle Falls.</b> On the southern slope in Edith Creek, a tributary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of the Paradise River. The name was given by Jules Stampfler,
the guide, in 1907. Myrtle was a member of one of his parties,
but he has forgotten the rest of her name.</p>

<p><b>Mystic Lake.</b> On the northern slope of the mountain, between
the Winthrop and Carbon Glaciers. It is a favorite place for
campers who expect to attempt the ascent of the mountain on its
northern slopes. Elevation, 5,750 feet above sea level. Named
by Prof. J. B. Flett and H. H. Garretson on account of a mysterious
temporary whirlpool seen near its outlet.</p>

<p><b>Nahunta Falls.</b> On the south slope. At one time the falls
had the name Marie, but it was changed at the suggestion of
Secretary Josephus Daniels of the United States Navy Department.
He says: "The name was familiar to me as one given by
the Carolina Tuscarora to a river in North Carolina and also to
their largest fort or 'head town.'" Secretary Daniels obtained
from the Bureau of American Ethnology information that the
name has appeared under various spellings and may mean "tall
trees" or "tall timbers."</p>

<p><b>Narada Falls.</b> On the south-central slope, the principal feature
of the lower Paradise River. An effort was recently made to
change the name to Cushman Falls in honor of the late Congressman
F. W. Cushman, a strong friend of the Park. The present
name is of Theosophical origin. Narada was a spiritual being
worshipped by the Brahman people in India by reason of his
service to the first race of men. Among modern Theosophists the
word has become a metaphysical subject, the greater part of which
is given to esoteric students and cannot be revealed. The word
itself means "uncontaminated." The wonderful beauty of the
scene, in its pure and original form, suggested the name to an early
group of visitors, Theosophists, consisting of the following persons:
Professor E. O. Schwägerl, Mr. and Mrs. George A. Sheffield,
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Knight, Miss Ida Wright (now Mrs. Vern
Mudgett), Mrs. Addie G. Barlow and Mr. Henry Carter. Elevation,
4,572 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>National Park Inn.</b> At Longmire Springs near the southwestern
entrance to the Park. This attractive hotel has frequently been
so overrun with guests that numerous tents have been used for
sleeping quarters. These are placed in the groves of pines and
firs on the bank of the Nisqually River. Many trips to interesting
parts of the mountain are made from the Inn. Elevation, 2,761
feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Natural Bridge.</b> In the north-central portion of the Park.
Many photographers have scrambled to the scene of this natural
curiosity. Elevation, 5,400 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Needle Creek.</b> Near the east-central boundary of the Park.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
It is a tributary of Kotsuck Creek and takes its rise near the sharp
cliffs of Cowlitz Chimneys, which may have suggested the name
"Needle."</p>

<p><b>Needle Rock.</b> On the northwest slope, overlooking the North
Mowich Glacier. The name was given by Professor J. B. Flett
from its supposed resemblance to Cleopatra's Needle. Elevation,
7,587 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Nisqually Glacier.</b> The large glacier flowing from the southern
flank of Mount Rainier. It was named by Stevens and Van
Trump in 1870 when they found it to be the source of Nisqually
River.</p>

<p><b>Nisqually River.</b> Rising at the foot of Nisqually Glacier, it
flows southwesterly through the Park and empties into Puget
Sound between Tacoma and Olympia. It was mentioned in the
Journal of John Work of the Hudson's Bay Company, as early as
1824. The first settlement by white men on Puget Sound was
made by the Hudson's Bay Company near its mouth in May, 1833.
That trading post was called Nisqually House. Rev. Myron Eells,
the talented missionary, says the word comes from the native word,
"Squally-o-bish," from the tribe of that name.</p>

In 1885 it was named Observation Point by Prof. L. F. Henderson.
An extensive view of western Washington is to be had from its top.
Elevation, 8,364 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Ohanapecosh Glacier.</b> On the east-central slope of the mountain.
Below the glacier lies the beautiful Ohanapecosh Park, from
which flows the river of the same name, which passes out of the
Park at the northeastern corner of the boundary. The name is
Indian, but its meaning has not been ascertained.</p>

<p><b>Old Desolate.</b> A ridge in the northwestern portion of the Park
between Moraine and Vernal Parks.</p>

<p><b>Ollala Creek.</b> In the southeastern corner of the Park. The
name is from the Chinook jargon, meaning "berries."</p>

<p><b>Owyhigh Lakes.</b> Near the east-central boundary of the Park.
The Yakima had a great war leader, Chief Owhigh, and this is
apparently an honor for him. See narrative by Theodore Winthrop
in this book, Chapter IV.</p>

<p><b>Paradise River.</b> Stevens and Van Trump called the river
Glacier Creek in 1870.</p>

<p><b>Paradise Valley.</b> On the south-central slope. This is the best
known part of the Park. David Longmire says that his mother
(wife of the pioneer, James Longmire) and a Mrs. Jameson were the
first women to visit the region. As they wound up the zigzag
trail through the forest they were suddenly in the midst of most
wonderful mountain scenery. "O, what a paradise!" exclaimed
one. "Yes, a real paradise," answered the other. That was in
1885, and the name Paradise has remained in use for the valley
and has also been extended to the river and the glacier from which
it takes its source.</p>

<p><b>Paul Peak.</b> In the northwestern corner of the Park. Origin of
name not ascertained.</p>

<p><b>Peak Success.</b> The southern summit of Mount Rainier. It
was named in 1870 by Stevens and Van Trump on the occasion of

slope is St. Andrews Rock, at the entrance to Sunset Amphitheatre.</p>

<p><b>St. Elmo Pass.</b> On the north slope, through the ridge that
divides the Winthrop and Inter Glaciers. It was named by
Major E. S. Ingraham, who says: "In 1887, I camped on the
ridge with my party. During the night a great thunderstorm
arose and we could hear the peals of thunder below. A couple of
boys who were with the party were sleeping above us. Suddenly
they called out that the storm was over because they could see the
stars. I, too, saw stars, but I did not think they were real. I got
up and began to investigate. What the boys thought were stars
was St. Elmo fire which had settled on their alpenstocks. Even
the cooking utensils were aflame with it, and our heads shone. I
explained the phenomenon and the place was called St. Elmo
Pass." Elevation, 7,415 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>South Mowich.</b> See Mowich.</p>

<p><b>South Tahoma.</b> See Tahoma.</p>

<p><b>Spray Falls.</b> On the northwestern slope of the mountain. The
highest and most beautiful falls on the north side of the mountain.
It was probably named when the Bailey Willis trail was built by it
in 1883. The abundant water breaks into a mass of spray. Elevation,
5,300 feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Spray Park.</b> Above Spray Falls lies this extensive and most
beautiful park. Its elevation is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet above sea

Spray Falls. The name originated at the falls and was later extended
to the creek and park.</p>

<p><b>Spukwush Creek.</b> Flowing from Chenuis Mountain to Carbon
River in the northwestern portion of the Park. The name seems
to be Indian, but its origin has not been ascertained.</p>

<p><b>Squaw Lake.</b> On the southwestern slope of the mountain, near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>

mountain. It is named for the miner who has maintained a camp
there for a number of years. Further information is given under
the head of Glacier Basin.</p>

<p><b>Steamboat Prow.</b> On the north slope of the mountain. The
appropriateness of this name is apparent to any who have visited

pointed cliff seems to be buffeting a sea of ice. Elevation, 9,500
feet above sea level.</p>

<p><b>Stevens Glacier.</b> On the southeastern slope, adjoining Paradise
Glacier. The name is in honor of General Hazard Stevens who,
with P. B. Van Trump, made the first ascent of the mountain in
1870. The creek flowing from the glacier is called Stevens Creek;
its deep bed is Stevens Canyon, and the overlooking crags are
Stevens Ridge.</p>

some falls, Sylvia Falls, after his sweetheart, and she has not spoken
to him since."</p>

<p><b>Tahoma Glacier.</b> On the southwest slope of the mountain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
beginning at Sunset Amphitheatre and draining into the South
Fork of the Puyallup River. Just south of this glacier is another
called South Tahoma Glacier, which drains into Tahoma Creek,
which in turn flows into the Nisqually River at the southwestern
corner of the Park. The name is one of the forms of the word
Tacoma. Stevens and Van Trump gave the name to what is now
known as Liberty Cap at the summit. The name is also applied
to a most prominent peak on the eastern slope of the mountain.
See Little Tahoma.</p>

J. H. Weer, of Tacoma, who has done extensive exploration work
upon and around the mountain. He was leader of The Mountaineers,
in 1915, when the first large party encircled the mountain at
snow-line.</p>

<p><b>White River.</b> This river drains most of the glaciers on the
northeastern slopes of the mountain. With a grand sweep around
the mountain, the river flows through its valley to unite with the
Black River near Seattle, becoming the Duwamish River, which
empties into Puget Sound at Seattle Harbor. Its name came from
the glacial character of the water.</p>

<p><b>White River Park.</b> Lying between Sourdough Mountains and
Sunrise Ridge in the northeastern part of the Park.</p>

<p><b>Whitman Glacier.</b> On the eastern slope of the mountain
flowing from the side of Little Tahoma. The name is in honor

<p>A complete and well-balanced treatment of United
States history. Industrial and social changes, rather
than the traditional grouping of topics on changes
of administration, etc., have determined the division of
the subject into periods and of the periods into chapters.
The space devoted to wars has been reduced
to the minimum and more space has been given to
the record of the nation's political, industrial, and
social progress, emphasizing the advancement of the
United States within the last fifty years. It presents
American history as a part of world history. The
treatment covers all the important points required by
the Committee of Eight in its Report to the American
Historical Association. The style is vivid and interesting;
the sentences are short and vigorous and the
paragraphs are topical units. The book abounds in
illuminating "side lights" always interesting and relevant.
Suggestions for collateral study and reading
are provided and study questions are given at the
close of each chapter.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The purpose of 'Earth Features and their Meaning,' by Professor
W. H. Hobbs, is primarily to furnish a readable work on miscellaneous
topics of modern geology and physical geography. In his preface the
author lays stress on the fact that the book is a series of readings to
stimulate the traveler to appreciate the landscape wherever he may
go. A special emphasis is laid upon earthquakes, volcanoes, the work
of water, desert processes, and glaciers....</p>

<p>"The book is noteworthy for the importance given to the experimental
method in geology, for good reading references at the end of
each chapter, for an unusually good analysis of weathering and the
surface processes of dry regions, such as dune accumulations in the
deserts, and for original treatment of glaciation."&mdash;<i>Nation.</i></p>

<p>"The subject matter is presented in such an interesting and intelligent
manner that the general reader and student will receive from
its study such an understanding of the subject that he will be able,
in his travels, to recognize many of the earth's features about which
he has read. The landscapes which are represented are very largely
those which are along the routes of travel. Much stress has been
placed on the dependence of the chief geological processes of a region,

Lieutenant Richard Arnold, in Pacific Railway Reports, Volume XII, Part I,
page 191, says: "Near the junction of Whitewater and Green rivers there is a remarkable
peak called La Tête, from a large rock on its slope resembling the head and
neck of a man. This is an important point, as it forms the gate of the mountains
on the west." Modern maps shift the "water" part of the names. They are
now White and Greenwater rivers.</p></div>

I have no doubt that the south branch of the Nachess, which flows to the east
into the Columbia, and that the Puyallup and White rivers, which flow west into
Puget Sound, have similar sources in glaciers, from the fact that in July they are
all of a similar character with the Nesqually, muddy, white torrents, at a time when
little rain has fallen for months.&mdash;Kautz.</p></div>

Tak-ho&#8242;ma or Ta-ho&#8242;ma among the Yakimas, Klickitats, Puyallups, Nisquallys,
and allied tribes of Indians, is the generic term for mountain, used precisely
as we use the word "mount," as Takhoma Wynatchie, or Mount Wynatchie.
But they all designate Rainier simply as Takhoma, or The Mountain, just as the
mountain men used to call it the "Old He." (Note in the original article.)</p></div>

The terraces to which reference is here made are not the work of the sea, but
of lakes whose waters gathered between the mountain slopes and retreating
glaciers of the ice period. See the article by H. I. Bretz. Geol. Survey of Wash.,
Bull. 8, 1912.</p></div>
